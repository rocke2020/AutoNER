IgA
nephropathy
(
IgAN
)
is
the
most
common
glomerulonephritis
in
the
world
.

The
disease
is
characterized
by
galactose
deficient
IgA
(
gd
-
IgA
)
in
the
circulation
forming
immune
complexes
.

The
complexes
are
deposited
in
the
glomerular
mesangium
leading
to
inflammation
and
loss
of
renal
function
,
but
the
pathophysiology
of
the
disease
is
still
not
fully
understood
.

Using
an
integrated
global
transcriptomic
and
proteomic
profiling
approach
we
investigated
the
role
of
the
mesangium
in
the
onset
and
progression
of
IgAN
.

Global
gene
expression
was
investigated
by
microarray
analysis
of
the
glomerular
compartment
of
renal
biopsies
from
patients
with
IgAN
.

The
influence
of
galactose
deficient
IgA
(
gd
-
IgA
)
on
mesangial
cells
was
investigated
by
proteomic
profiling
.

By
utilizing
the
previous
published
literature
curated
glomerular
cell
type
-
specific
genes
,
we
found
that
mesangial
cells
and
their
positive
standard
genes
play
a
more
dominant
role
in
IgAN
comparing
to
the
podocyte
standard
genes
.

Additionally
,
the
patient
clinical
parameters
(
serum
creatinine
values
and
estimated
glomerular
filtration
rate
-
eGFR
)
significantly
correlate
with
z
-
scores
derived
from
expression
profile
of
mesangial
cell
positive
standard
genes
.

22
common
pathways
were
identified
both
from
in
vivo
microarray
data
and
in
vitro
mesangial
cell
mass
spectrometry
data
and
the
main
part
was
inflammatory
pathways
.

The
correlation
between
clinical
data
and
mesangial
standard
genes
allows
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
onset
of
IgAN
.

 
The
genes
,
proteins
and
their
corresponding
pathways
identified
in
this
paper
give
us
novel
insights
into
the
pathophysiological
mechanisms
leading
to
progression
of
IgAN
.

RNA
from
glomerular

was
extracted
and
processed
for
hybridization
on
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

This
dataset
is
part
of
the
TransQST
collection
.

We
analyzed
three
clinical
parameters
with
gene
expression
data
from
122
liver
tissues
.

Six
healthy
samples
were
used
in
validation
.

All
hepatitis
samples
were
HBV
infected
,
which
was
validated
by
positive
HBsAg
or
serum
HBV
-
DNA
.

The
samples
with
HCV
infection
or
metabolic
liver
injury
(
e.g.
fatty
liver
,
chronic
alcoholic
hepatitis
,
etc
.
)
were
excluded
.

This
dataset
is

With
350
million
carriers
worldwide
who
may
suffer
from
serious
sequelae
,
including
hepatocellular
carcinoma
,
chronic
hepatitis
B
virus
(
CHB
)
infection
remains
an
important
health
issue
.

Current
antiviral
therapies
hardly
eradicate
the
virus
.

Therefore
,
there
are
still
imperative
need
to
develop
new
therapeutic
strategies
and
predictors
for
treatment
response
to
cure
the
disease
and
avoid
futile
treatment
.

By
taking
the
advantage
of
having
the
paired
liver
biopsy
samples
of
IFNalpha
responders
before
/
after
treatment
and
pretreatment
samples
from
responders
and
non
-
responders
,
we
could
characterize
the
intrahepatic
expression
profiles
associated
with
necroinflammatory
activity
and
the
profiles
/
signature
potentially
predictive
of
response
to

for

in
this
study
.

RNA
was
extracted
from

.

 
The

Polyoma
virus
nephropathy
(
PVAN
)
is
a
common
cause
of
kidney
allograft
dysfunction
and
loss
.

Microscopic
descriptions
of
PVAN
are
very
similar
to
T
-
cell
mediated
rejection
(
TCMR
)
and
have
unclear
underlying
molecular
mechanisms
.

To
identify
PVAN
-
specific
gene
expression
,
we
analyzed
162
kidney
biopsies
with
and
without
PVAN
for
global
gene
expression
.

Unsupervised
hierarchical
clustering
analysis
of
all
162
biopsies
revealed
high
similarity
between
PVAN
and
TCMR
gene
expression
.

Increasing
the
stringency
for
the
specificity
(
p
<
0.001
and
>
2
-
fold
expression
)
between
PVAN
and
TCMR
,
158
and
252
unique
PVAN
and
TCMR
injury
-
specific
probesets
were
observed
,
respectively
.

While
TCMR
-
specific
probeset
were
overwhelmingly
involved
in
immune
response
costimulation
(
CTLA4
,
CD28
,
CD86
)
and
TCR
(
NFATC2
,
LCP2
)
signaling
,
PVAN
-
specific
probesets
were
mainly
related
to
viral
replication
process
(
IFITM1
,
LTF
,
NOSIP
,
RARRES3
)
,
RNA
polymerase
assembly
(
POLR2l
,
TAF10
,
RPS15
)
and
pathogen
recognition
receptors
(
C1QA
,
C3
,
CFD
)
.

A
principal
component
analysis
using
these
genes
further
confirmed
the
most
optimal
separation
between
the
3
different
clinical
phenotypes
.

Validation
of
4
PVAN
-
specific
probesets
(
RPS15
,
CFD
,
LTF
,
and
NOSIP
)
by
QPCR
and
further
confirmation
by
IHC
of
2
PVAN
-
specific
proteins
with
anti
-
viral
function
(
LTF
and
IFITM1
)
was
done
,
showing
significantly
higher
expression
within
interstitial
cellular
infiltrates
and
in
tubuli
in
PVAN
specimens
as
compared
to
TCMR
and
NL
kidney
biopsies
.

In
conclusion
,
even
though
PVAN
and
TCMR
kidney
allografts
share
great
similarities
on
gene
perturbation
,
particular
PVAN
-
specific
transcripts
were
identified
with
well
-
known
anti
-
viral
properties
that
provide
tools
for
discerning
PVAN
and
AR
as
well
as
attractive
targets
for
rational
drug
design
.

A
total
of
168
kidney
biopsies
from
kidney
transplant
patients
were
used
.

The
kidney
biopsies
included
renal
biopsies
from
PVAN
(

,
T

)
(

Individuals
from
different
populations
vary
considerably
in
their
susceptibility
to
immune
-
related
diseases
.

To
understand
how
genetic
variation
and
natural
selection
contribute
to
these
differences
,
we
tested
for
the
effects
of
African
versus
European
ancestry
on
the
transcriptional
response
of
primary
macrophages
to
live
bacterial
pathogens
.

12
%
of
macrophage
-
expressed
genes
show
ancestry
-
associated
differences
in
the
gene
regulatory
response
to
infection
,
and
African
ancestry
specifically
predicts
a
stronger
inflammatory
response
and
reduced
intracellular
bacterial
growth
.

A
large
proportion
of
these
differences
are
under
genetic
control
:
for
569
genes
,
more
than
75
%
of
ancestry
effects
on
the
immune
response
can
be
explained
by
a
single
cis-
or
trans
-
acting
eQTL
.

Finally
,
we
show
that
genetic
effects
on
the
immune
response
are
strongly
enriched
for
recent
,
population
-
specific
signatures
of
adaptation
.

Together
,
our
results
demonstrate
how
historical
selective
events
continue
to
shape
human
phenotypic
diversity
today
,
including
for
traits
that
are
central
to
coping
with
infection
.

Schizophrenia
(
SZ
)
and
bipolar
disorder
(
BD
)
are
severe
neuropsychiatric
disorders
with
serious
impact
on
patients
,
together
termed
major
psychosis
.

Recently
,
long
intergenic
non
-
coding
RNAs
(
lincRNAs
)
were
reported
to
play
important
roles
in
mental
diseases
.

However
,
little
was
known
about
their
molecular
mechanism
in
pathogenesis
of
SZ
and
BD
.

Here
,
we
performed
RNA
sequencing
on
82
post
-
mortem
brain
tissues
from
three
brain
regions
(
orbitofrontal
cortex
(
BA11
)
,
anterior
cingulate
cortex
(
BA24
)
and
dorsolateral
prefrontal
cortex
(
BA9
)
)
of
patients
with
SZ
and
BD
and
control
subjects
,
generating
over
one
billion
reads
.

We
characterized
lincRNA
transcriptome
in
the
three
brain
regions
and
identified
20
differentially
expressed
lincRNAs
(
DELincRNAs
)
in
BA11
for
BD
,
34
and
1
in
BA24
and
BA9
for
SZ
,
respectively
.

Our
results
showed
that
these
DELincRNAs
exhibited
brain
region
-
specific
patterns
.

Applying
weighted
gene
co
-
expression
network
analysis
,
we
revealed
that
DELincRNAs
together
with
other
genes
can
function
as
modules
to
perform
different
functions
in
different
brain
regions
,
such
as
immune
system
development
in
BA24
and
oligodendrocyte
differentiation
in
BA9
.

Additionally
,
we
found
that
DNA
methylation
alteration
could
partly
explain
the
dysregulation
of
lincRNAs
,
some
of
which
could
function
as
enhancers
in
the
pathogenesis
of
major
psychosis
.

Together
,
we
performed
systematical
characterization
of
dysfunctional
lincRNAs
in
multiple
brain
regions
of
major
psychosis
,
which
provided
a
valuable
resource
to
understand
their
roles
in
SZ
and
BD
pathology
and
helped
to
discover
novel
biomarkers
.

of
82
brain

We
performed
RNA
sequencing
on
three
brain

namely
the
BA11
(

)
,

there
were

We
confirmed
immune

as
the
key
mechanism
and
provided
solid
evidence
for
novel
genes
(
e.g.
,
FCAR

)
and
distinct

processes
(
e.g.

Treatment
with
angiotensin
converting
enzyme
inhibitors
(
ACEI
)
or
angiotensin
receptor
blockers
(
ARB
)
has
been
shown
to
have
anti

inflammatory
effects
such
as
decreased
growth
factors
and
cytokines
in
animal
models
,
this
effect
however
,
has
not
been
investigated
in
kidney
transplant
recipients
.

 
We
aimed
to
study
the
effect
of
ACEI
or
ARB
treatment
on
intragraft
gene
expression
profiles
of
transplant
kidney
biopsies
using
microarrays
.

Both
groups
had
similar
demographic
characteristics
in
terms
of
age
,
race
,
sex
,
type
of
transplant
,
previous
history
of

or
acute

,
panel
reactive

levels
,
and
immunosuppressive
treatment
.

There
were
no
differences
in
acute
and
chronic
Banff
allograft
injury
scores
between
the
2
Groups
.

Intragraft
gene
expression
profiles
of
ACEI
or
ARB
treated
Group
2
biopsies
showed
decreased
gene
transcripts
of
interferon

gamma
and
rejection
-
associated
transcripts
(
GRIT
)
and
constitutive
macrophage
-
associated
transcripts
(
CMAT
)
compared
to
Group
1
biopsies
.

There
were
no
statistically
significant
differences
in
expression
of
cytotoxic
T
cell
(
CAT
)
,
regulatory
T
cell
(
TREG
)
,
B

)
,
or
endothelial
cell
-
associated
transcripts
(
ENDAT
)
between
the
2
Groups
.

 
Our
data
suggest
that
exposure
to
ACEI
or
ARB
was
associated
with
down
-
regulation
of
GRIT
and
CMAT
.

This
anti
-
inflammatory
effect
of
ACEI
or
ARB
treatment
could
be
an
additional
benefit
in
kidney
transplant
recipients
.

We
identified
29

)
,
patients
with

treatment
and
Group
2
patients
(
n=13
)
with
exposure
to
ACEI
or

at
least
6
months
prior
to
kidney

.

 
Biopsies
with
a
diagnosis
of
acute

,
recurrent
or
de

,
or
polyoma
nephropathy
were
excluded
.

Cancer
testis
antigens
(
CTAs
)
are
of
clinical
interest
as
biomarkers
and
present
valuable
targets
for
immunotherapy
.

To
comprehensively
characterize
the
CTA
landscape
of
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
,
we
compared
RNAseq
data
of
199
NSCLC
tissues
to
the
normal
transcriptome
of
142
samples
from
32
different
normal
organs
.

Of
232
CTAs
currently
annotated
in
the
CTdatabase
,
96
were
confirmed
in
NSCLC
.

To
obtain
an
unbiased
CTA
profile
of
NSCLC
,
we
applied
stringent
criteria
on
our
RNAseq
data
set
and
defined
90
genes
as
CTAs
,
of
which
55
genes
were
not
annotated
in
the
CTdatabase
.

Cluster
analysis
revealed
that
CTA
expression
is
histology
-
dependent
and
concurrent
expression
is
common
.

Immunohistochemistry
confirmed
tissue
specific
protein
expression
of
selected
genes
.

Furthermore
,
methylation
was
identified
as
a
regulatory
mechanism
of
CTA
expression
based
on
independent
data
from
the
Cancer
Genome
Atlas
.

The
proposed
prognostic
impact

Blood

were
obtained
from
two

3
clinical
trials
conducted
by
the
members
of
the
Pediatric

Organization
(

and

(

(

)
.

For
patients
,
baseline
and
day
3
samples
were
analyzed
for
either
placebo
or
canakinumab
(

treatment
.

Clinical
response
was
assessed
at
day

using
adapted
JIA
American
College
of

response
criteria
.

Overall
,
206
samples
were
used
in
this
study
including
22
samples
from
healthy
controls
,
33
samples
of
placebo
treated
patients
and
151
samples
of
canakinumab
treated
patients
.

We
identified
that
knocking
down
Map4k4
in
endothelial
cells
affected
genes
associated
with
the
cell
cycle
,
mitosis
,
and
inflammatory
genes
.

We
used
microarrays
to
identify
genes
of
interest
that
are
differentially
expressed
after
the
addition
of
scrambled
or
Map4k4
siRNA
.

HUVECs
were
treated
with
scrambled
or
siMap4k4
.

24
hours
later
,
cells
were
serum
starved
overnight
.

Cells
were
prepared
with
this
protocol
on
three
different
occasions
,
and
total
RNA
was
isolated
to
provide
three
biological
replicates
per
sample
.

The
natural
history
of
chronic
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
infection
could
be
divided
in
different
phases
by
transaminase
and
HBV
replication
levels
.

However
,
it
remains
unknown
how
the
intrahepatic
transcriptomes
in
patients
are
correlated
with
the
clinical
phases
.

Here
,
we
determined
the
intrahepatic
transcriptomes
of
chronic
hepatitis
B
patients
and
examined
the
role
of
specific
groups
of
genes
,
including
immune
-
related
genes
,
in
the
control
of
hepatitis
B
virus
infection
.

The
transcriptomes
of
83
chronic
hepatitis
B
patients
(
22
immune
tolerant
,
50
immune
clearance
,
and
11
inactive
carrier
state
)
were
analyzed
by
performing
microarray
analysis
of
liver
biopsies
.

KEGG
pathway
analysis
showed
that
immune
response
genes
and
interferon
-
stimulated
genes
were
up
-
regulated
in
the
immune
clearance
phase
.

Although
immune
tolerant
patients
and
inactive
state
carriers
had
significantly
different
serum
viral
loads
,
the
hepatic
transcriptomes
of
the
two
groups
were
largely
similar
and
only
significantly
differed
in
the
expression
of
109
genes
(
p
<
0.01
)
.

Thus
,
we
hypothesized
that
some
of
the
109
genes
may
be
involved
in
HBV
control
and
identified
genes
of
interest
by
performing
systematic
screening
using
specific
siRNAs
.

We
showed
that
silencing
candidate
genes
such
as
EVA1A
resulted
in
significantly
increased
viral
replication
.

Conversely
,
overexpression
of
candidate
genes
suppressed
virus
replication
.

Conclusions
:
The
immune
related
pathways
were
up
-
regulated
in
the
immune
clearance
phase
but
not
in
the
inactive
carrier
phase
.

A
number
of
host
genes
unrelated
to
immune
pathways
were
expressed
in
the
inactive
carrier
phase
and
these
may
participate
in
the
control
of
hepatitis
B
virus
replication
,
resulting
in
low
viral
replication
.

The
water
extract
of
the
leaf
of
B.
racemosa
had
been
reported
to
posses
high
phenolic
content
and
showed
high
antioxidant
activities
.

However
,
scientific
data
on
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
beneficial
properties
of
the
leaf
extract
are
still
lacking
.

In
this
study
,
the
effects
of
the
leaf
extract
on
the
expression
of
genes
in
cultured
HepG2
cells
were
investigated
using
microarray
technology
.

The
leaf
extract
significantly
regulated
the
expression
of
genes
involved
with
consequential
impact
on
the
glycolysis
,
gluconeogenesis
and
metabolism
of
xenobiotics
.

HepG2

and
treated
with
an

Following
this
,
cells
were
trypsinized
and
then
preciptated
by

.

Cells
were
washed
with
phosphate
buffer
saline
(

)
before

)
were
extracted
from
the
cells
.

tcRNA
from
both

were
selected
for
RNA

and
hybridization
on

.

All

were
done
in

.

The
microarray
analysis
was
performed
on
Affymetrix
Human
Gene

S.T
Array
according
to
the

.

The
gene

were
then
subjected
to
analysis
of

)
in
the
Partek
Genomics
Suite
software
to
determine
significantly

which
was
set
according
to

Lyme
disease
is
challenging
to
diagnose
,
as
clinical
manifestations
are
variable
and
current
tools
to
detect
nucleic
acid
or
antibody
responses
from
Borrelia
burgdorferi
infection
have
low
sensitivity
.

 
Here
we
conducted
the
first
study
of
the
global
transcriptome
of
patients
with
Lyme
disease
to
identify
potential
diagnostic
biomarkers
.

 
Twenty
-
nine
patients
were
enrolled
and
compared
to
13
healthy
controls
at
three
time
points
after
infection
.

 
Fifteen
publicly
available
transcriptome
datasets
from
patients
in

or
infection
models
in
vitro
were
used
to
assess
specificity
of
differentially
expressed
genes
(
DEGs
)
.

 
We
found
that
Lyme
disease
results
in
profound
and
sustained
changes
in
the
patient
transcriptomes
,
with
a
specific
signature
that
shares
44
%
DEGs
with
other
infections
.

  
Gene
expression
profile
from
peripheral
mononuclear
blood
cells
(
PBMC
)
of
Lyme

patients
against
healthy
controls
was
undertaken
.

A

,
and
6

(

)
.

13
healthy

were
also
sampled
at

Even

has
entered
the
age
of

,
platinum

.

 
In
the
absence
of
well

defined
genomic
biomarkers
,
clinical
efficacy
signals
in
genomically
distinct
subsets
of
SCLC
could
have
been
missed
.

Serine
/
Arginine
Splicing
Factor
1
(
SRSF1
)
is
a
member
of
SR
protein
family
.

The
deleterious
consequences
of
overexpression
of
the
SRSF1
proto
-
oncogene
in
human
cancers
suggest
that
there
are
complex
mechanisms
and
pathways
underlying
SRSF1

transformation
(

)
.

Whole
exome
and
transcriptome
sequencing
of
primary
tumor
SCLC
from
99
Chinese
patients
has
identified
SRSF1
DNA
amplification
and
mRNA
over
-
expression
which
predicts
poor
survival
in
Chinese
SCLC
patients
.

In

and
in
vivo
studies
have
demonstrated
that
SRSF1
is
essential
for
tumorigenecity
of
SCLC
and
plays
a
key
role
in
DNA
repair
and
chemo
-
sensitivity
.

We
did
RNAseq
on
79
small

We
normalized

Rationale
:
Interstitial
fibrosis
and
tubular
atrophy
(
IFTA
)
is
found
in
~25
%
of
1
-
year
biopsies
post
-
transplant(1
,
2
)
.

It
correlates
with
decreased
graft
survival
when
histological
evidence
of
inflammation
is
present–í.(3
-
5
)
Identifying
the
etiology
of
IFTA
is
important
because
longterm
graft
survival
has
not
changed
as
expected
given
improved
therapies
and
a
dramatically
reduced
incidence
of
acute
rejection.(6
-
8)
   
Methods
:
Gene
expression
profiles
of
234
samples
were
obtained
with
matching
clinical
and
outcome
data
(
7
transplant
centers
)
.

81

IFTA
samples
were
divided
into
subphenotypes
by
the
degree
of
inflammation
on
histology
:
IFTA
with
acute
rejection
(
AR
)
,
IFTA
with
inflammation
and
IFTA
without
inflammation
.

Samples
with
AR
(
n=54
)
and
normally
functioning
transplants
(
TX
;
n=99
)
were
used
in
comparisons
.

  
Conclusions
:
 
Gene
expression
profiling
of
all
IFTA
phenotypes
were
strongly
enriched
for
cAR
gene
dysregulation
pathways
,
including
IFTA
samples
without
histological
evidence
of
inflammation
.

Thus
,
by
molecular
profiling
we
demonstrate
that
most
IFTA
samples
have
ongoing
immune
-
mediated
injury
or
chronic
rejection
that
is
more
sensitively
detected
by
gene
expression
profiling
.

We
also
found
that
the
relative
expression
of
AR
-
affiliated
genes
correlated
with
future
graft
loss
in
IFTA
samples
without
inflammation
.

We
conclude
that
undetected
and/or
undertreated
immune
rejection
is
leading
to
IFTA
and
graft
failure
.

Background
:
Negative
-
pressure
wound
therapy
has
become
widely
available
in
modern
chronic
wound
cares
.

Accelerated
keratinocyte
(
HaCaT
cell
)
movements
and
decreased
E
-
cadherin
expressions
induced
by
the
applied
negative
pressure
gradient
of
125
mmHg
(
NP
)
have
been
reported
in
previous
studies
.

However
,
the
molecular
mechanism
for
E
-
cadherin
regulations
under
NP
remains
unexplored
.

We
highlighted
the
signal
transduction
involved
in
NP
-
induced
E
-
cadherin
regulation
for
keratinocytes
in
the
study
.

Results
:

Microarray
results
showed
that
catenin
1
(
CTNND1
)
gene
,
the
gene
encoding
the
p120
-
catenin
(
p120ctn
)
in
cell
-
cell
junctions
,
was
significantly
(
p
=
0.0005
)
upregulated
in
HaCaT
cells
under
NP
for
12
hours
in
comparison
with
those
at
ambient
pressure
(
AP
)
.

Cell
fractionations
and
immunoblotting
data
showed
that
NP
increased
p120ctn
phosphorylation
,
and
resulted
in
p120ctn
translocation
from
the
plasma
membrane
to
the
cytoplasm
.

Fluorescent
stains
suggested
that
NP
diminished
the
co
-
localization
of
p120ctn
and
E
-
cadherin
on
the
plasma
membrane
.

Similar
phenomenon
was
also
observed
in
the
cells
with
overexpressed
p120ctn
at
NP
.

Interestingly
,
overexpression
of
dN-
p120ctn
,
a
deletion
mutant
of
p120ctn
without
the
N
-
terminal
phosphorylation
sites
,
restored
the
adherens
junctions
(
AJ
)
at
NP
.

Knockdown
of
p120ctn
with
lentiviral
small
hairpin
RNA
not
only
diminished
E
-
cadherin
expressions
but
also
accelerated
cell
movement
at
AP
.

 
Conclusions
:
Phosphorylation
of
p120ctn
is
endowed
to
respond
rapidly
to
NP
and
contributes
to
the
AJ
disassembly
.

This
NP
-
induced
E
-
cadherin
downregulation
can
possibly
accelerate
wound
-
healing
process
.

Cerebellar

patients

.

 
The
neurodegenerative
disease
known
as
ataxia
-
telangiectasia
(
A
-
T
)
is
caused
by
the
absence
of
the
ATM
(
A
-
T
mutated
)
protein
.

A
long
-
standing
mystery
surrounding
A
-
T
is
why
cerebellar
Purkinje
cells
(
PCs
)
appear
uniquely
vulnerable
to
ATM
-
deficiency
.

Here
,
we
present
that
5
-
hydroxymethylcytosine
(
5hmC
)
,
a
newly
recognized
epigenetic
marker
found
at
high
levels
in
neurons
,
is
substantially
reduced
in
human
A
-
T
and
Atm-/-
mouse
cerebellar
PCs
.

TET1
,
an
enzyme
that
converts
5mC
to
5hmC
,
responds
to
DNA
damage
.

Manipulation
of
TET1
activity
directly
affects
neuronal
cell
cycle
reentry
and
cell
death
after
the
induction
of
DNA
damage
.

Quantitative
,
genome
-
wide
analysis
of
5hmC
of
samples
from
human
cerebellum
showed
that
in
ATM
-
deficiency
there
is
a
remarkable
genome
-
wide
reduction
of
5hmC
enrichment
at
both
proximal
and
distal
regulatory
elements
.

These
results
reveal
a
role
of
TET1
-
mediated
5hmC
in
DNA
damage

,
and
provide
insights
into

disease
(

)
is
a
chronic
progressive
neurodegenerative
disorder
that
is
clinically
defined
in

.

These
are
preceded
by
prodromal
non

manifestations
that
prove
the
systemic
nature
of
the
disease
.

Identifying
genes
and
pathways
altered
in

provide
new
information
on
the
diagnosis

.

We
study
changes
in
gene
expression
in
the
blood
of
40
sporadic

patients
and
20
healthy

(
Discovery

)
by
taking
advantage
of
the

.

Patients
were
at
the

of
these
are
also
present
in

,
already
found
in

,
we
unveiled
transcriptome
changes
enriched
in
biological
terms
related
to
epigenetic

including
chromatin

.

Candidate

were
validated
by

in

.

Our

It
identifies

Several
studies
have
shown
that

While
negative
correlations
are
consistent
with
a
faster
degradation
of

,
the
presence
of
positive

suggests
bidirectional
interactions
between
the
two

.

However
,
a

Vitiligo
is
an
acquired
depigmentation
of
the
skin
inducing
a
marked
alteration
of
the
quality
of
life
of
affected
individuals
.

Halting
the
disease
progression
and
repigmenting
the
lesional
skin
represent
the
two
faces
of
the
therapeutic
challenge
in
vitiligo
.

So
far
,
none
of
them
has
been
successfully
addressed
.

Oxidative
stress
and
immune
system
in
genetically
predisposed
individuals
participate
to
the
complex
pathophysiology
of
vitiligo
.

We
performed
a
transcriptome
and
proteomic
analysis
on
lesional
,
perilesional
and
non
-
depigmented
skin
of
vitiligo
patients
compared
to
matched
skin
controls
of
healthy
subjects
.

Our
results
show
that
the
WNT
pathway
,
implicated
in
melanocytes
differentiation
,
was
found
to
be
altered
in
vitiligo
skin
.

We
demonstrated
that
the
oxidative
stress
decreases
WNT
expression
/
activation
in
keratinocytes
and
in
melanocytes
.

We
developed
an
ex

skin
model
that
remains
functional
up
to
15
days
.

We
then
confirmed
the
decreased
activation
of
the
WNT
pathway
in
human
skin
subjected
to
oxidative
stress
.

Finally
,
using
pharmacological
agents
that
activate
the
WNT
pathway
,
we
treated
the
ex
vivo
depigmented
skins
from
vitiligo
patients
and
successfully
induced
the
differentiation
of
resident
stem

into
pre

ELABELA
(
ELA
)
is
a
peptide
hormone
required
for
heart
development
that
signals
via
the
Apelin
Receptor
(
APLNR
,
APJ
)
.

ELA
is
also
abundantly
secreted
by
human
embryonic
stem
cells
(
hESCs
)
,
which
do
not
express
APLNR
.

 
Here
we
show
that
ELA
signals
in
a
paracrine
fashion
in
hESCs
to
maintain
self
-
renewal
.

ELA
inhibition
by
CRISPR

,

or

antibodies
causes

show
that
it
activates
PI3K

signaling
required
for

.

ELA
promotes

cell

,

.

INSULIN
and
ELA
have
partially
overlapping
functions
in
hESC
medium
,
but
only
ELA
can
potentiate
the
TGF
_
pathway
to
prime
hESCs
towards
the
endoderm
lineage
.

We
propose
that
ELA
,
acting
through
an
alternate
cell

surface
receptor
,
is
an
endogenous
secreted
growth
factor
in
human

Implantation
is
dependent
on
synchronized
interactions
between
the
conceptus
and
surrounding
decidual
cells
but
the
involvement
of
clock
genes
in
this
process
is
not
well
understood
.

Circadian
oscillations
are
predicated
on
transcriptional
-
translational
feedback
loops
,
which
balance
the
activities
of
the
transcriptional
activators
CLOCK
and
BMAL1
and
repressors
encoded
by
PER
and
CRY
genes
.

Here
we
show
that
loss
of
PER2
expression
silences
circadian
oscillations
in
decidualizing
human
endometrial
stromal
cells
(
HESCs
)
.

Downregulation
was
preceded
by
reduced
CLOCK
binding
to
a
noncanonical
E
-
box
enhancer
in
the
PER2
promoter
and
occurred
between
12
-
24
h
after
exposure
to
a
deciduogenic
stimulus
.

RNA
sequencing
revealed
that
premature
inhibition
of
PER2
by
siRNA
knockdown
leads
to
a
grossly
disorganised
decidual
response
.

Gene
ontology
analysis
highlighted
a
preponderance
of
cell
cycle
regulators
amongst
the
1,121
genes
perturbed
upon
PER2
knockdown
.

Congruently
,
PER2
inhibition
abrogated
mitotic
expansion
of
differentiating
HESCs
by
inducing
cell
cycle
block
at
G2
/
M.
Analysis
of
mid
-
luteal
endometrial
biopsies
revealed
an
inverse
correlation
between
PER2
transcript
levels
and
the
number
of
miscarriages
in
women
suffering
reproductive
failure
.

Thus
,
PER2
synchronizes
mitotic
expansion
of
HESCs
with
a
periodic
decidual
gene
expression
;
uncoupling
of
these
events
may
cause
persistent

have

)
as
a

.

DISC1
is
interrupted
by
a
balanced
chr(1;11
)

in
a
Scottish

,
in
which
the

.

We
investigate
the
consequences
of
DISC1
interruption
in
human

cells
using
TALENs
or

to
target
the
DISC1
locus
.

We
sought
to
compare
the
gene

profiles
of
human
neural

)
and
neurons
with
interruption
of
the

HGF
stimulates
mitogenesis

Selective

blocks
spontaneous

,
but
not

,
in
the
prostate

PC3
M
cell
xenograft
model
.

To
identify
the
HGF
activated
genes
and
pathways
that
contribute
to
cell
motility
and
invasion
,
i.e.
the
HGF
invasive
program
,
expression
profiling
was
performed
on
PC3
M
cells
that
were
untreated
or
were
treated
with
human
HGF
(
hHGF
)
,
which
drives
all

primary
activities
,
or
with
human
HGF
/
NK2
(
hNK2
)
or
murine
HGF
(
mHGF
)
,
which
drive
motility
and
invasion
but
not
proliferation
in
human
cells
.

Differences
in
gene
expression
profiles
among
these
four
groups
were
used
to
distiniguish
between
events
associated
with
invasion
(
resulting
from
hNK2
or
mHGF
treatment
)
from
those
associated
with
the
combination
of
invasion
and
proliferation
(
resulting
from
hHGF
treatment
)
.

PC3
M
cells
were
left
untreated
or
treated
with
hHGF
,
hNK2
or
mHGF
for
8

A
microarray
analysis
with
renal
biopsy
specimens
from
CKD
patients
was
conducted
in
order
to
identify
the
responsible
genes
associated
with
tubulointerstitial
fibrosis
and
tubular
cell
injury
in
CKD
.

This
study
showed
microarray
profiles
in
total
53
biopsy
specimens
of
CKD
patients
.

In
the
discovery
set
,
554
down
-
regulated
and
226
up
-
regulated
signatures
were
identified
.

Then
,
the
expressional
changes
of
these
genes
were
examined
in
the
validation
set
.

Gene
expression
profiles
in
human
chronic
kidney
disease
was
explored
using
renal
biopsy
specimens
.

Two
independent
studies
:
discovery
set
and
validation
set
were
performed
.

This
dataset
is
part
of
the
TransQST
collection
.

Macrophages
play
a
key
role
in
both
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
,
but
our
knowledge
on
the
changes
in
transcription
regulation
that
occurs
during
their
differentiation
from
monocytes
is
still
limited
.

In
this
study
,
we
used
a
meta
-
analysis
followed
by
a
systems
biology
approach
for
the
identification
of
differentially
expressed
genes
between
monocytes
and
macrophages
and
possible
regulators
of
these
changes
in
transcription
.

Based
on
the
pattern
of
gene
expression
change
,
transcription
regulator
analysis
predicted
a
decrease
in
Enhancer
of
Zeste
homolog
2
(
EZH2
)
,
a
histone
3
lysine
27
methyl
transferase
,
activity
after
differentiation
of
monocytes
into
macrophages
.

This
inhibition
was
validated
by
a
significant
decrease
in
trimethylated
H3K27
during
differentiation
of
both
human
primary
monocytes
into
macrophages
and
the
THP-1
cell
line
into
macrophage
-
like
cells
.

Overexpressing
EZH2
during
differentiation
of
monocytes
and
THP-1
cells
obstructs
cellular
adhesion
,
thus
preventing
the
first
step
in
differentiation
.

Another
facet
of
macrophage
differentiation
is
the
cessation
of
proliferation
,
and
inhibition
of
EZH2
by
the
small
molecule
inhibitor
GSK126
in
THP-1
cells
indeed
impedes
proliferation
.

This
study
shows
an
important
part
for
epigenetic
changes
during
monocyte
differentiation
.

It
highlights
the
role
of
EZH2
activity
behind
the
changes
needed
in
adhesion
and
proliferation
mechanisms
for
macrophage
formation
.

THP-1s
were
treated
with
the
EZH2
inhibitor
GSK126
for
phenotypic
and
genotypic
analysis
.

Increasing
evidence
suggests
that
defective
RNA
processing
contributes
to
the
development
of
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
(
ALS
)
.

This
may
be
especially
true
for
ALS
caused
by
a
repeat
expansion
in
C9orf72
(
c9ALS
)
,
in
which
the
accumulation
of
RNA
foci
and
dipeptide
-
repeat
proteins
are
expected
to
modify
RNA
metabolism
.

We
report
extensive
alternative
splicing
(
AS
)
and
alternative

)
defects
in
the
cerebellum
of
c9ALS
cases
(

after
6
days
of

With

we
identified
several
genes
whose

was
similarly
up-

.

Human

Bisphenol
A
(
BPA
)
is
a
xenobiotic
endocrine
disrupting
chemical
.

In
vitro
and
in
vivo
studies
indicated
that
BPA
alters
endocrine
-
metabolic
pathways
in
adipose
tissue
increasing
the
risk
of
developing
metabolic
disorders
.

BPA
effects
on
human
adipocytes
,
specifically
in
children
,
are
poorly
investigated
.

To
investigate
in
childhood
the
effect
of
exposure
to
BPA
on
metabolic
disorders
we
analyzed
in
vitro
the
effects
of
environmentally
relevant
doses
of
BPA
on
gene
expression
of
mature
human
adipocytes
from
pre
-
pubertal
lean
patients
and
on
related
physiological
outcomes
.

Adipocytes
from
children
were
treated
in
vitro
with
BPA
and
gene
expression
was
evaluated
by
qRT
-
PCR
.

Genome
wide
analyses
were
performed
using
GeneChip
Human
Gene
1.0
ST
array
.

Lipid
content
in

was
estimated
by

and
Triglyceride

Kit
.

Secreted

culture
medium
,
and
insulin
,
in
PANC-1

,
were
performed
using
ELISA
assays
.

BPA
was
found
to
promote
up
-
regulation
of
ER
_
and
ERR
_
,
and
down
-
regulation
of
GPR30
expression
modulating
estrogen
signaling
and
following
a
non
-
linear
dose
-
response
.

Microarray
data
analysis
demonstrated
that
BPA
increases
the
gene
expression
of
pro
-
inflammatory
cytokines
and
lipid
metabolism
-
related
FABP4
and
CD36
in
adipocytes
.

PCSK1
resulted
the
most
interesting
gene
being
down
-
regulated
by
BPA
thus
impairing
insulin
production
in
pancreas
.

BPA
promotes
inflammation
and
lipid
metabolism
dysregulation
in
adipocytes
from
lean
children
.

Moreover
,
PCSK1
can
be
a
key
gene
in
BPA
action
modulating
insulin
production
.

Exposure
to
BPA
in
childhood
may
be
an
important
risk
factor
in
developing
obesity
and
metabolic

.

7
days
upon
RAS
induction
(
when
the
cells
reach
a
fully
senescent
phenotype
)
we
collected
the
RNA
.

ZFP36L1
is
a
RNA
binding
protein
that
binds
to
AU
-
rich
elements
in
the
3–•UTR
of
mRNAs
and
triggers
their
degradation
.

Our
previous
experiments
showed
that
the
activity
of
ZFP36L1
was
key
in
the
regulation
of
the
senescent
phenotype
.

By
performing
RNAseq
we
have
uncovered
the
effect
of
expressing
a
constitutively
active
mutant
of
ZFP36L1
within
the
senescent
transcriptome

Here
,
we
investigate
how
repeated
wound
stimulus
leads
to
seminal
changes
in
gene
expression
and
the
onset
of
a
perpetual

of

-

in
retinal

RPE
)
cells
,
a
cell
-
type
central
to
the
etiology
of
AMD
.

Using
a
human
fetal
RPE
cell
culture
model
that
considers
monolayer
disruption
and
subconfluent
culture
as
a
proxy
for
wound
stimulus
,
we
have
shown
that
prolonged
wound
stimulus
leads
to
terminal
acquisition
of
a
mesenchymal
phenotype
post
-
confluence
and
altered
expression
of
more
than
40
%
of
the
transcriptome
(
see
GEO
:
GSE62224
)
.

In
contrast
,
at
subconfluence
fewer
than
5
%
of
expressed
transcripts
have
2

fold
or
greater
expression
differences
after
repeated

interactome
comprised
of
two
interconnected
modules
with
functions
pertaining
to
wound
response
and
cell
division
.

 
Among
the
wound

genes
are
the
TGFb

activators
:
TGFB1
,
TGFB2
,
INHBA

Stephen
Paget
first
proposed
,
in
1889
,
that
organ
distribution
of
metastases
is
a
non
-
random
event
,
yet
metastatic
organotropism
remains
one
of
the
greatest
mysteries
in
cancer
biology
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
that
exosomes
released
by
lung-
,
liver-
and
brain
-
tropic
tumor
cells
fuse
preferentially
with
resident
cells
at
their
predicted
destination
,
such
as
fibroblasts
and
epithelial
cells
in
the
lung
,
Kupffer
cells
in
the
liver
,
and
endothelial
cells
in
the
brain
.

We
found
that
exosome
homing
to
organ
-
specific
cell
types
prepares
the
pre
-
metastatic
niche
and
that
treatment
with
exosomes
derived
from
lung
tropic
models
can
redirect
metastasis
to
the
lung
.

Proteomic
profiling
of
exosomes
revealed
distinct
integrin
expression
patterns
associated
with
each
organ
-
specific
metastasis
.

Whereas
exosomal
integrins
_
6_4
and
_
6_1
were
associated
with
lung
metastasis
,
exosomal
integrins
_
v_5
and
_
v_3
were
linked
with
liver
and
brain
metastases
,
respectively
.

Targeting
_
6_4
and
_
v_5
integrins
decreased
exosome
uptake
and
metastasis
in
the
lung
and
liver
,
respectively
.

Importantly
,
we
demonstrate
that
exosome
uptake
activates
a
cell
-
specific
subset
of
S100
family
genes
,
known
to
support
cell
migration
and
niche
formation
.

Finally
,
our
clinical
data
indicate
that
integrin
-
expression
profiles
in
circulating
plasma
exosomes
from
cancer
patients
could
be
used
to
predict
organ
-
specific
metastasis
.

We
used

Aim
was
to

at
the
level
of

processing
Cervical
cancer
cells
permissive
for
HPV16

were
identified
and
characterized
.

These

that
bypassed
the

that
are
known

,
or
were
shown
by
a

array
analysis
to
overexpress
the
RALYL

.

Overexpression
of
RALYL
,
or
RALY
and
hnRNP

that
are
two

,
induced

late
gene
expression
from
HPV16
subgenomic

and
from
episomal

of
the
full

HPV16
genome
.

Induction
of
HPV16
late
gene
expression
by
the
hnRNP
C
-
proteins
was
dependent
on
the
HPV16
early
untranslated
region
to
which
these
proteins
also
were
shown
to
bind
in
vitro
,
and
in
living
cells
.

Our
experiments
revealed
that
hnRNP
C
proteins
that
interacted
with
the
HPV16
early
untranslated
region
reached
out
to
the
splicing
silencer
complex
at
HPV16
SD3632
and
derepressed
this
splice
site
,
thereby
activating
production
of

.

In

Diagnosis
of
brucellosis
remains
challenging
for
several
reasons
,
including
lack
of
culture
sensitivity
,
nonspecific
symptomatology
,
and
high
prevalence
of
positive
serology
in
endemic
areas
.

The
main
objectives
of
this
study
were
to
identify
blood
biomarkers
specific
to
brucellosis
compared
to
other
endemic
infections
and
to
monitor
changes
in
blood
biomarkers
during
treatment
.

To
obtain
a
global
profile
of
the
disease
,
we
employed
RNA
sequencing
(
RNAseq
)
of
whole
blood
RNA
to
measure
host
response
against
brucellosis
infection
in
patients
from
Macedonia
and
Spain
.

Long
-
term
follow
up
of
patients
was
used
to
classify
patients
as
having
acute
or
chronic
/
reinfection
brucellosis
and
as
treatment
responders
and
non
-
responders
.

We
observed
distinct
gene
expression
differences
between
samples
from
acute
brucellosis
and
control
donors
.

The
magnitude
of
gene
expression
changes
was
associated
with
antibody
titers
determined
by
standard
serological
tests
for
brucellosis
,

The

that
of

In

integration
of
clinical

To

Rosacea
is
a
common
chronic
inflammatory
skin
disease
of
unknown
etiology
.

Our
knowledge
about
an
involvement
of
the
adaptive
immune
system
is
very
limited
.

We
performed
detailed
transcriptome
analysis
,
qRT

PCR
,
and
quantitative
immunohistochemistry
on
facial
biopsies
of
rosacea
patients
,
classified
according
to
their
clinical
subtype
.

As
controls
,
we
used
samples
from
healthy
controls
.

  
Our
study
shows
significant
activation
of
the
immune
system
in
all
subtypes
of
rosacea
,
characterizing
erythematotelangiectatic
rosacea
(
ETR
)
already
as
a
disease
with
significant
influx
of
proinflammatory
cells
.

The
T
cell
response
is
dominated
by
Th1

Th17
-
polarized
immune
cells
,
as
demonstrated
by
significant
upregulation
of
IFN

or
IL-17
,
for
example
.

Chemokine
expression
patterns
support
a
Th1

Th17
polarization
profile
of
the
T
cell
response
.

Macrophages
and
mast
cells
are
increased
in
all
three
subtypes
of
rosacea
,
while
neutrophils
reach
a
maximum
in
papulopustular
rosacea
.

Our
studies
also
provide
evidence
for
activation
of
plasma
cells
with
significant
antibody
production
already
in
ETR
,
followed
by
a
crescendo
pattern
towards
phymatous
rosacea
.

  
In
sum
,
Th1
/
Th17
polarized
inflammation
and
macrophage
infiltration
is
an
underestimated
hallmark
in
all
subtypes
of
rosacea
.

Therapies
directly
targeting
the
Th1

Th17
pathway
are
promising
candidates
in
the
future
treatment
of
this

RNAPII
pausing
/
termination
shortly
after
initiation
is
a
hallmark
of
gene
regulation
.

However
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
involved
are
still
to
be
uncovered
.

Here
,
we
show
that
NELF
interacts
with
Integrator
complex
subunits
(
INTScom
)
forming
a
stable
complex
with
RNPII
and
Spt5
.

The
interaction
between
NELF
and
INTScom
subunits
is
RNA
and
DNA
independent
.

Using
both
HIV-1
promoter
and
genome
wide
analyses
,
we
demonstrate
that
Integrator
subunits
specifically
control
NELF
-
mediated
RNAPII
pause
/
release
at
coding
genes
.

The
strength
of
RNAPII
pausing
is
determined
by
the
nature
of
the
NELF
-
associated
complex
.

Interestingly
,
in
addition
to
controlling
RNAPII
pause
release
INTS11
catalytic
subunit
of
the
INTScom
is
required
for
the
synthesis
of
full

.

Finally
,
INTScom

genes
are
enriched

and
in

in

To
study
the
gene
expression
after
administrating
an

vaccine
,
we
have
employed

profiling
to
emphasize
the
gene
expression
profile
of
the
immune
system
in
response
to
an

and
confirmed
that
such
an
immune

was
generated
as
the
result
of
the
positive

.

Human

OBJECTIVE
:
Acromegaly
is
a
rare
endocrine
disorder
with
excess
growth
hormone
(
GH
)
production
.

This
disorder
has
important
metabolic
effects
in
insulin
resistance
and
lipolysis
.

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
explore
transcriptional
changes
induced
by
GH
in
adipose
tissue
.

METHODS
:

The
patients
underwent
clinical
and
metabolic
profiling
including
assessment
of
HOMA
-
IR
.

Explants
of
adipose
tissue
were
assayed
ex
-
vivo
for
lipolysis
and
ceramide
levels
.

Adipose
tissue
was
analyzed
by
RNA
sequencing
(
RNA
-
seq
)
.

RESULTS
:

There
was
evidence
of
reduced
insulin
sensitivity
based
on
the
increase
in
fasting
glucose
,
insulin
and
HOMA
-
IR
score
.

We
observed
several
previously
reported
transcriptional
changes
(
IGF1
,
IGFBP3
)
as
well
as
several
novel
transcriptional
changes
,
some
of
which
may
be
important
for
GH
signal
regulation
(
PTPN3
and
PTPN4
)
and
the
effect
of
GH
on
growth
and
proliferation
.

Several
transcripts
could
potentially
be
important
in
GH
-
induced
metabolic
changes
.

Specifically
,
induction
of
LPL
,
ABHD5
,
and
ACVR1C
could
contribute
to
enhanced
lipolysis
and
may
explain
the
suggestive
enhancement
of
adipose
tissue
lipolysis
in
acromegaly
patients
as
reflected
by
glycerol
release
from
the
explants
of
the
two
groups
of
patients
(
p=0.09
)
.

Higher
expression
of
SCD
and
TCF7L2
could
contribute
to
insulin
resistance
.

Expression
of
HSD11B1
was
reduced
and
GR
was
increased
,
predicting
modified
glucocorticoid
activity
in
acromegaly
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

We
identified
the
acromegaly
gene
expression
signature
in
human
adipose
tissue
.

The
significance
of
altered
expression
of
specific
transcripts
will
enhance
our
understanding
of
the
metabolic
and
proliferative
changes
associated
with
acromegaly
.

DESIGN
:

Patients
with
acromegaly
(
n=9
)
or
non
-
functioning
pituitary
adenoma
(
n=11
)
were
prospectively
observed
from
March
2011
to
June
2012
.

Sequencing
was
performed
on
RNA
from
7
acromegaly
patients
and
11
controls
.

Tumor
epithelial
cells
develop
within
a
microenvironment
consisting
of
extracellular
matrix
,
growth
factors
,
and
cytokines
produced
by
non
-
epithelial
stromal
cells
.

In
response
to
paracrine
signals
from
tumor
epithelia
,
stromal
cells
modify
the
microenvironment
to
promote
tumor
growth
and
metastasis
.

Here
,
we
identify
interleukin
(
IL)-33
as
an
epithelial
cell
-
derived
regulator
of
stromal
cell
activation
and
mediator
of
intestinal
polyposis
.

IL-33
expression
was
elevated
in
the
tumors
and
serum
of
colorectal
cancer
patients
and
induced
in
the
adenomatous
polyps
of
ApcMin/+
mutant
mice
.

Genetic
and
antibody
suppression
of
IL-33
signaling
in
ApcMin/+
mice
inhibited
proliferation
,
induced
apoptosis
,
and
suppressed
angiogenesis
in
polyps
,
which
reduced
both
tumor
number
and
size
.

In
ApcMin/+
polyps
,
IL-33
expression
localized
to
tumor
epithelial
cells
and
expression
of
the
IL-33
receptor
,
IL1RL1
,
associated
with
two
stromal
cell
types
,
namely
subepithelial
myofibroblasts
(
SEMFs
)
and
mast
cells
,
whose
activation
was
previously
associated
with
polyposis
.

In
vitro
IL-33
stimulation
of
human
SEMFs
induced
the
expression
of
extracellular
matrix
components
and
growth
factors
associated
with
intestinal
tumor
progression
.

IL-33
deficiency
reduced
mast
cell
accumulation
in
ApcMin/+
polyps
and
expression
of
mast
cell
-
derived
proteases
and
cytokines
known
to
promote
polyposis
.

Together
,
our
results
suggest
that
IL-33
is
a
tumor
epithelial
cell
-
derived
paracrine
signal
that
promotes
polyposis
through
the
coordinated
activation
of
stromal
cells
and
the
formation
of
a
reactive
stroma
microenvironment
.

About
50
%
of
human
malignancies
exhibit
unregulated
signalling
through
the
Ras
-
ERK1/2
(
ERK
)
pathway
,
as
a
consequence
of
activating
mutations
in
members
of
Ras
and
Raf
families
.

However
,
the
quest
for
alternative
Ras
-
ERK
pathway
-
directed
therapies
is
desirable
.

Upon
phosphorylation
ERK
dimerize
.

We
had
previously
demonstrated
that
dimerization
is
essential
for
ERK
extranuclear
but
not
nuclear
signaling
.

Furthermore
,
by
molecular
biology
approaches
,
we
showed
that
specifically
inhibiting
ERK
extranuclear
component
,
by
impeding
ERK
dimerization
,
is
sufficient
for
curtailing
tumor
progression
.

Here
,
we
have
identified
a
small
molecule
inhibitor
for
ERK
dimerization
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
that
,
without
affecting
ERK
phosphorylation
,
prevents
tumorigenesis
driven
by
Ras
-
ERK
pathway
oncogenes
,
both
in
cellular
and
animal
models
.

Importantly
,
this
compound
is
unaffected
by
resistance
-
acquisition
processes
that
hamper
–¢classical–£
Ras
-
ERK
pathway
inhibitors
.

Thus
,
ERK
dimerization
inhibitors
provide
the
proof
of
principle
for
two
novel
concepts
in
cancer
therapy
:
1
)

The
blockade
of
sublocalization
-
specific
sub
-
signals
,
rather
than
total
signals
,
as
a
means
of
effectively
counteracting
oncogenic
Ras
-
ERK
signaling
.

Targeting

-
protein
interactions
such
as
dimerization
,
rather
than
catalytic
activities
,
within
a
signaling
route
,
as
an
approach
for
producing
effective
anti
-
tumoral
agents
.

Strategies
aimed
at
preventing
aberrant
flux
through
this
route
remain
an
attractive
option
for
therapeutic
intervention
in
cancer
.

In
this
respect
,
drugs
inhibiting
the
kinase
activities
of
BRaf
and
MEK
have
yielded
promising
results
.

The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
investigate
the
role
of
PAEP
and
its
protein
product
glycodelin
in

cancer
cell

.

Cells
were

During
cerebellar
development
,
the
main
portion
of
the
cerebellar
plate
neuroepithelium
(
NE
)
gives
birth
to
Purkinje
cells
and
interneurons
,
while
the
germinal
zone
at
its
dorsal
edge
,
called
the
rhombic
lip
(
RL
)
,
generates
granule
cells
and
cerebellar
nuclei
neurons
.

However
,
it
remains
elusive
how
these
components
work
together
to
generate
the
intricate
structure
of
the
cerebellar
anlage
.

In
this
study
,
we
found
that
a
polarized
cerebellar
anlage
structure
self
-
organizes
in
three
-
dimensional
(
3D
)
human
ES
cell
(
hESC
)
culture
.

This
NE
is
capable
of
differentiating
into
electrophysiologically
functional
Purkinje
cells
.

The
addition
of
FGF19
promotes
spontaneous
generation
of
dorsoventrally
polarized
NE
structures
containing
cerebellar
and
basal
plates
.

Furthermore
,
further
addition
of
SDF1
promoted
the
generation
of
stratified
cerebellar
plate
NE
with
RL
-
like
germinal
zones
self
-
forming
at
the
edge
.

Thus
,
hESC
-
derived
cerebellar
progenitors
exhibit
substantial
self
-

Ewing
Sarcoma
is
caused
by
a
pathognomonic
genomic
translocation
that
places
an
N
-
terminal
EWSR1
gene
in
approximation
with
one
of
several
ETS
genes
(
typically
FLI1
)
.

This
aberration
,
in
turn
,
alters
the
transcriptional
regulation
of
more
than
five
hundred
genes
and
perturbs
a
number
of
critical
pathways
that
promote
oncogenesis
,
cell
growth
,
invasion
,
and
metastasis
.

Among
them
,
translocation
-
mediated
up
-
regulation
of
the
insulin
-
like
growth
factor
receptor
1
(
IGF-1R
)
and
mammalian
 
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
are
of
particular
importance
since
they
work
in
concert
to
facilitate
IGF-1R
expression
and
ligand
-
induced
activation
,
respectively
,
of
proven
importance
in
ES
transformation
.

When
used
as
a
single
agent
in
Ewing
sarcoma
therapy
,
IGF-1R
or
mTOR
inhibition
leads
to
rapid
counter
-
regulatory
effects
that
blunt
the
intended
therapeutic
purpose
.

Therefore
,

mechanisms
of
resistance
that
are
used
by
Ewing
sarcoma
to
evade
cell
death
to
single

of
therapeutic
combinations
that

Microphthalmia
-

(
MITF
)
is
the
master
regulator
of
the
melanocyte

.

By
tandem

,
we
present
a
comprehensive
characterisation
of
the
MITF
interactome
comprising
multiple
novel
cofactors
involved
in
transcription
,
DNA
replication
and
repair
and
chromatin
organisation
,
including
a
BRG1
chromatin
remodelling
complex
comprising
CHD7
.

BRG1
is
essential
for
melanoma
cell
proliferation
in

and
for
normal
melanocyte
development
in
vivo
.

MITF
and
SOX10
actively
recruit
BRG1
to
a
set
of
MITF
-
associated
regulatory
elements
(
MAREs
)
at

enhancers
.

MITF
,
SOX10
and
YY1
bind
between
two
BRG1
-
occupied
nucleosomes
thus
defining
both
a
combinatorial
signature
of
transcription
factors
essential
for
the
melanocyte
lineage
and
a
specific
chromatin
organisation
of
MAREs
.

Nevertheless
,
BRG1

enhances
MITF
occupancy
at
MAREs
showing
that
BRG1
acts
to
promote
dynamic
MITF
interactions
with

Following

,

Besides
being
building
blocks
for
protein
synthesis
,
amino
acids
serve
a
wide
variety
of
cellular
functions
,
including
acting
as
metabolic
intermediates
for
ATP
generation
and
for
redox
homeostasis
.

Upon
amino
acid
deprivation
,
free
uncharged
tRNAs
trigger
GCN2
-
ATF4
to
mediate
the
well
-
characterized
transcriptional
amino
acid
response
(
AAR
)
.

However
,
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
deprivation
of
different
individual
amino
acids
triggers
identical
or
distinct
AARs
.

Here
,
we
characterized
the
global
transcriptional
response
upon
deprivation
of
one
amino
acid
at
a
time
.

With
the
exception
of
glycine
,
which
was
not
required
for
the
proliferation
of
MCF7
cells
,
we
found
that
the
deprivation
of
most
amino
acids
triggered
a
shared
transcriptional
response
that
included
the
activation
of
ATF4
,
p53
and
TXNIP
.

However
,
there
was
also
significant
heterogeneity
among
different
individual
AARs
.

The
most
dramatic
transcriptional
response
was
triggered
by
methionine
deprivation
,
which
activated
an
extensive
and
unique
response
in
different
cell
types
.

We
uncovered
that
the
specific
methionine
-
deprived
transcriptional
response
required
creatine
biosynthesis
.

This
dependency
on
creatine
biosynthesis
was
caused
by
the
consumption
of
S
-
Adenosyl
-
L
-
methionine
(
SAM
)
during
creatine
biosynthesis
that
helps
to
deplete
SAM
under
methionine
deprivation
and
reduces
histone
methylations
.

As
such
,
the
simultaneous
deprivation
of
methionine
and
sources
of
creatine
biosynthesis
(
either
arginine
or
glycine
)
abolished
the
reduction
of
histone
methylation
and
the
methionine
-
specific
transcriptional
response
.

Arginine
-
derived
ornithine
was
also
required
for
the
complete
induction
of
the
methionine
-
deprived
specific
gene
response
.

Collectively
,
our
data
identify
a
previously
unknown
set
of
heterogeneous
amino
acid
responses
and
reveal
a
distinct
methionine
-
deprived
transcriptional
response
that
results
from
the
crosstalk
of
arginine
,
glycine
and
methionine
metabolism
via
arginine
/
glycine
-
dependent
creatine
biosynthesis
.

Myelodysplastic
syndromes
and
chronic
myelomonocytic
leukemia
(
CMML
)
are
characterized
by
mutations
in
epigenetic
modifiers
and

.

DNA
methyltransferase
inhibitors
(

)
are
used
to
treat
these
disorders
,
but
response
is
highly
variable
with
few
means
to
predict
which
patients
will
benefit
.

To
develop
a
molecular
means
of
predicting
response
at
diagnosis
,
we
examined
baseline
differences
in
mutations
,
DNA
methylation
,
and
gene
expression
in
40
CMML
patients
responsive
and
resistant
to
decitabine
(
DAC
)
.

While
somatic
mutations
did
not
differentiate
responders
and
non
-
responders
,
we
were
able
to
identify
for
the
first
time
158
differentially
methylated
regions
(
DMRs
)
at
baseline
between
responders
and
non
-
responders
using
next
-
generation
sequencing
.

These
DMRs
were
primarily
localized
to
non
-
promoter
regions
and
overlapped
with
distal
regulatory
enhancers
.

Using
the
methylation
profiles
,
we
developed
an
epigenetic
classifier
that
accurately
predicted
DAC
response
at
the
time
of
diagnosis
.

We
also
found
53
differentially
expressed
genes
between
responders
and
non
-
responders
.

Genes
up
-
regulated
in
responders
were
enriched
in
the
cell
cycle
,
potentially
contributing
to
effective
DAC
incorporation
.

Two
chemokines
overexpressed
in
non

--

and
CXCL7
--
were
able
to
block
the
effect
of
DAC
on
normal
CD34
+
and
primary
CMML
cells
in

,
suggesting
their
up

contributes
to

Neuroblastoma
is
an
embryonal
tumor
which
originates
from
neural
crest
progenitor
cells
that
fail
to
differentiate
along
their
predefined
route
to
sympathetic
neurons
or
sympatho
-
adrenergic
adrenal
cells
.

It
is
the
most
common
extracranial
tumor
of
childhood
and
accounts
for
15
%
of
all
childhood
cancer
deaths
.

Especially
patients
suffering
from
high
grade
or
relapsed
neuroblastoma
have
poor
outcome
in
spite
of
aggressive
treatment
regimens
including
autologous
stem
cell
transplantation
.

Those
patients
are
in
urgent
need
of
additional
effective
therapies
which
demands
the
development
of
targeted
approaches
.

Dihydroorotatedehydrogenase
(
DHODH
)
is
the
fourth
enzyme
of
the
pyrimidine
synthesis
pathway
which
oxidizes
dihydroorotate
to
orotate
.

In
recent
past
it
became
a
potential
drug
target
for
cancer
treatment
because
of
its
keyrole
in
processing
essential
pyrimidine
nucleotides
.

On
the
basis
of
the
existing
data
,
functional
inhibition
of
DHODH
is
considered
to
be
promising
therapeutic
option
for
several
tumor
entities
like
advanced
colorectal
,
breast
or
lung
-
cancers
.

Leflunomide
is
an
established
drug
in
treatment
of
the
autoimmune
diseases
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
multiple
sclerosis
.

In
the
liver
Leflunomide
becomes
converted
to
its
active
metabolite
called
Teriflunomide
,
which
inhibits
the
activity
of
DHODH
directly
.

In
recent
times
Leflunomide
is
also
used
for
therapy
against
the
Cytomegalovirus
and
the
BK
virus
.

Also
for
Melanoma
was
shown
recently
a
decreased
growth
rate
due
to
Leflunomide
treatment
in
a
zebrafish
and
a
mouse
model
.

As
Melanoma
is
a
malignant
tumor
of
the
skin
,
which
derives
also
from
neural
crest
progenitor
cells
,
a
coherent
investigation
of
effictivity
of
Leflunomide
in
neuroblastoma
celllines
showed
first
promising
results
.

The
aim
of
our
study
was
to
reanalyse
the
effectivity
of
Leflunomide
in
Neuroblastoma
and
to
shed
further
light
in
its
biological
mode
of
action
.

Primary
cells
enter
replicative
senescence
after

.

This
process
is
associated
with
reproducible
changes
in
DNA
methylation
(
DNAm
)
at
specific
sites
in
the
genome
.

The
mechanism
that
drives
senescence

DNAm
changes
remains
unknown
and
may
arise
through
drift
in
DNAm

through

It
is
fundamentally
unknown
how
normal
cellular
processes
or
responses
to
extracellular
stimuli
may
invoke
polyadenylation
and
degradation
of
ncRNA
substrates
or
if
human
disease
processes
exhibit
defects
in
polyadenylation
of
ncRNA
substrates
as
part
of
their
pathogenesis
.

Our
results
demonstrate
that
mononuclear
cells
from
subjects
with
relapsing

remitting
multiple
sclerosis
(
RRMS
)
exhibit
pervasive
increases
in
levels
of
polyadenylated
ncRNAs
including
Y1
RNA
,
18S
and
28S
rRNA
,
and
U1
,
U2
,
and
U4
snRNAs
and
these
defects
are
unique
to
RRMS
.

Defects
in
expression
of
both
Ro60
and
La
proteins
in
RRMS
appear
to
contribute
to
increased
polyadenylation
of
ncRNAs
.

Further
,
IFN-_1b
,
a
common
RRMS
therapy
,
restores
both
Ro60
and
La
levels
to
normal
as
well
as
levels
of
polyadenylated
Y1
RNA
and
U1
snRNA
suggesting
that
aberrant
polyadenylation
of
ncRNA
substrates
may
have
pathogenic
consequences
.

The

family

)
encodes
transcriptional

,
several
of
which
are
deregulated
in

.

We
found
that
loss
of
Prdm11
accelerates
MYC
-
driven
lymphomagenesis
in
the
E¬µ-Myc
mouse
model
.

Moreover
,
we
show
that
patients
with
PRDM11
-
deficient

lymphomas
(
DLBCLs
)
have
poorer
overall
survival
and
belong
to

Mechanistically
,
genome
-
wide
mapping
of

coupled

in

evidenced
that
PRDM11
associates
with
transcriptional
start
sites
of
target
genes
and
regulates
important
oncogenes
such
as
FOS
and
JUN
.

 
Hence
,
we
characterize
PRDM11
as
a
novel
tumor
suppressor
controlling
the
expression
of
key
oncogenes
and
add
new

insight
into

(

was
performed
to
determine

that
are
unique

identified
sets
of
genes
associated
with

specific
viral

.

 
These
genes
are
related
to
inflammatory
pathways
,
epithelial

and
cilium
assembly
and
function
,
including
those
described
previously
(
e.g.
CCL5
,

)
,
and
novel
ones
that
were
identified
for
the
first
time
in
this
study
(
e.g.

)
.

  
We
concluded
that
air

challenged
with
live

are
a
useful
in

model
for
the
study
of

asthma
exacerbation
,
given
that
our
findings
are
consistent
with
clinical
data
sets
.

 
Furthermore
,
our
data
suggest
that
abnormal
airway
epithelial
structure
and
inflammatory
signaling
are
important
contributors
to
viral
induced
asthma
exacerbation
.

From
our
previous
data
,
we
found
that
loss
of
ATAD3A
gene
expression
in
breast

cells
results
in
loss
of
cell

in

and
metastasis
in

.

To
obtain
a
better
understanding
of
oncogenic
pathway
of
ATAD3A
,
we
have
established
the
stable
ATAD3A
knockdown

cells
using

strategy
.

We
used
the
whole

to
detail
the

programme
of
gene
expression
after

of
ATAD3A
and
identified
distinct

To

we

MEIS2
has
an
important
role
in
development
and
organogenesis
,
and
is
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
human
cancer
.

The
molecular
basis
of
MEIS2
action
in
tumorigenesis
is
not
clear
.

Here
,
we
show
that
MEIS2
is
highly
expressed
in
human
neuroblastoma
cell
lines
and
is
required
for
neuroblastoma
cell
survival
and
proliferation
.

Depletion
of
MEIS2
in
neuroblastoma
cells
leads
to
M
phase
arrest
and
mitotic
catastrophe
,
whereas
ectopic
expression
of
MEIS2
markedly
enhances
neuroblastoma
cell
proliferation
,
anchorage
-
independent
growth
,
and
tumorigenicity
.

Gene
expression
profiling
reveals
an
essential
role
of
MEIS2
in
maintaining
the
expression
of
a
large
number
of
late
cell
cycle
genes
,
including
those
required
for
DNA
replication
,
G2
-
M
checkpoint
control
and
M
phase
progression
.

Importantly
,
we
identify
MEIS2
as
a
transcription
activator
of
the
MuvB
-
BMYB
-
FOXM1
complex
that
functions
as
a
master
regulator
of
mitotic
gene
expression
.

Further
,
we
show
that
FOXM1
is
a
direct
target
gene
of
MEIS2
and
is
required
for
MEIS2
to
upregulate
mitotic
genes
.

These
findings
link
a
development
gene
to
the
control
of
cell
cycle
progression
and
suggest
that
high
MEIS2
expression
is
a
molecular
mechanism
for
high
expression
of
mitotic
genes
that
is
commonly
observed
in
cancers
of
poor
prognosis
.

,
transcriptomic

from

,
and

,
were
analyzed
to

.

Gene

of

EPN
were
contrasted
to
identify

(

.

Candidate

genes
were
examined
across
a
broader
cohort
of

Background
:
It
has
been
shown
that
intracellular
pathogens
hijack
DC
functions
to
evade
immune
defense
mechanisms
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
responses
of
human
monocyte
derived
DCs
to
four
intracellular
bacteria
,
Tropheryma
whipplei
,
Coxiella
burnetii
,
Brucella
abortus
and
Orientia
tsutsugamushi
,
responsible
for
human
infectious
diseases
and
known
to
infect
myeloid
cells
.

Methods
:
Whole
genome
microarrays
were
assessed
to
define
common
and
specific
transcriptionnal
responses
to
bacterial
pathogen
.

Bacterial
pathogen
ability
to
affect
DC
maturation
was
assessed
by
measuring
lymphoproliferation
and
endocytosis
as
well
as
phenotypic
maturation
markers
(
CD80
,
CD83
,
CD86
and
HLA
-
DR
)
expression
.

Results
:
We
found
that
Coxiella
burnetii
,
Orientia
tsutsugamushi
and
Brucella
abortus
induced
DC
maturation
assessed
through
decreased
endocytosis
ability
,
triggering
lymphoproliferation
,
surface
expression
of
HLA
class
II
molecules
and
phenotypic
changes
,
whereas
Tropheryma
whipplei
did
not
induce
DC
maturation
.

As
revealed
by
microarray
analysis
,
the
response
of
DCs
to
these
bacteria
consisted
of
a
core
associated
with
the
maturation
of
DCs
and
signatures
specific
for
each
pathogen
.

The
core
response
represented
10
%
of
genes
modulated
in
response
to
pathogens
and
consisted
of
general
cellular
processes
including
nucleotide
binding
,
protein
transport
,
cell
fraction
,
protein
kinase
,
cell
cycle
,
mitochondrial
membrane
and
cytoskeleton
.

The
specific
transcriptional
signature
induced
by
C.
burnetii
is
associated
with
the
communication
between
innate
and
adaptive
immune
cells
and
DC
maturation
.

B.
abortus
signature
specifically
involved
arachidonic
acid
and
lipooxygenase
pathways
and
O.
tsutsugamushi
signature
involved
type
I
and
type
III
IFN
responses
.

Conclusion
:
This
study
demonstrates
that
intracellular
bacteria
use
multifaceted
pathways
to
induce
DC
maturation
which
may
lead
to
unadapted
immune
response
.

The
understanding
of
these
pathways
may
be
useful
to
improve
our
knowledge
of
bacterial
recognition
by
the
immune
system
but
also
intracellular
bacterial
diseases
.

changes
from

Epithelial
-
to
-
mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
is
a
dynamic
process
that
relies
on
cellular
plasticity
;
an
EMT
/
MET
axis
is
critical
for
metastatic
colonization
of
carcinomas
.

Unlike
epithelial
programming
,
regulation
of
mesenchymal
programming
is
not
well
understood
in
EMT
.

Here
we
describe
the
first
microRNA
that
enhances
exclusively
mesenchymal
programming
.

We
demonstrate
that
microRNA-424
is
up
-
regulated
early
during
a
TWIST1
/
SNAI1
-
induced
EMT
,
and
that
it
causes
cells
to
express
mesenchymal
genes
without
affecting
epithelial
genes
,
resulting
in
a
mixed
/
intermediate
EMT
.

Further
,
microRNA-424
increases
motility
,
decreases
adhesion
and
induces
a
growth
arrest
,
changes
associated
with
a
complete
EMT
.

Patient
microRNA-424
levels
positively
associate
with
TWIST1/2
and
EMT
-
like
gene
signatures
and
is
increased
in
primary
tumors
versus
matched
normal
breast
.

However
,
microRNA-424
is
down
-
regulated
in
metastases
versus
matched
primary
tumors
.

Correspondingly
,
microRNA-424
decreases
tumor
initiation
and
is
post
-
transcriptionally
down
-
regulated
in
macrometastases
in
mice
.

RNA
-
seq
identified
microRNA-424
regulates
numerous
genes
associated
with
EMT
and
breast
cancer
stemness
including
the
novel
miR-424
target
,
TGFBR3
,
which
regulates
mesenchymal
phenotypes
without
influencing
miR-424
effects
on
tumor
-
initiating
phenotypes
;
instead
,
we
show
that
ERK
signaling
is
critical
for
such
tumor
-
initiating
effects
of
miR-424
.

These
findings
suggest
microRNA-424
plays
distinct
roles
downstream
of
EMT
-
inducing
factors
,
facilitating
earlier
stages
,
but
repressing
later
stages
,
of
metastasis
.

,
have
been
suggested
to
be
crucial
to
the
evolutionary
expansion
of
the
human
cortex
.

We
combined
cell
type
-
specific
sorting
with
transcriptome
-
wide
RNA
-
sequencing
to
identify
genes
enriched
in
human
ORG
,
including
targets
of
the
transcription
factor
Neurogenin
,
and
previously
uncharacterized
,
evolutionarily
dynamic
,
long
noncoding
RNAs
.

Single
-
cell
transcriptional
profiling
of
human
,
ferret
,
and
mouse
progenitors
showed
that
more
human
RGC
co
-
express
proneural
Neurogenin
targets
than
in
ferret
or
mouse
,
suggesting
greater
self
-
renewal
of
neuronal
lineage
-
committed
progenitors
in
humans
.

Finally
,
we
show
that
activating
the
Neurogenin
pathway
in
ferret
RGC
promotes
delamination
and
outward
migration
.

Thus
,
we
find
that
the
abundance
of
human
ORG
is
paralleled
by
increased
transcriptional
heterogeneity
of
cortical
progenitors
.

Three

of
human

(
18
to

)
were
dissociated
and
immunolabeled
.

Apical
and
outer
radial
glial
cells
were
purified
by
FACS
and
compared
to
an
immunonegative
population
,
predominantly

.

We
have
found
that
thyroid
hormones
(

,
acting

integrin
_

ligands
,
activate
growth

)
.

Specifically
,
TH

,
in

CUTLL1
cells
were
treated
with
T3-
and

for
24hrs
.

Total

was
harvested
from

and
used
for

We
identified
histidine
triad
nucleotide
binding
protein
1
(
HINT1
)
as
a
human
teneurin-1
ICD
interaction
partner
in
a
yeast-2
hybrid
screen
.

This
interaction
was
confirmed
in
human
cells
,
where
HINT1
is
known
to
inhibit
the
transcription
of
target
genes
by
directly
binding
to
transcription
factors
at
the
promoter
.

In
a
whole
transcriptome
analysis
of
BS149
glioblastoma
cells
overexpressing
the
teneurin-1
ICD
,
several
microphthalmia
-
associated
transcription
factor
(
MITF
)
target
genes
were
found
to
be
up
-
regulated
.

Interestingly
,
MITF
is
one
of
the
transcription
factors
inhibited
by
HINT1
.

Thus
,
we
directly
compare
the
transcriptomes
of
MITF
versus
TEN1
-
ICD
overexpressing
BS149
cells
in
this
study
,
in
order
to
reveal
any
co
-
regulated
genes
.

For
the
whole
transcriptome
analysis
of
MITF
,
cells
were
transiently
transfected
in
triplicates
with
either
,
pcDNA3.1
-
RFP
-
HA
(
negative

)
or
pcDNA3.1
-
MITF
-
RFP
-

.

The
overexpressing
cells
were
then
FACS
-
sorted
directly
into
RLT
lysis

(
Qiagen
)
at
a
3:1

Teneurins
are
large
type
II
transmembrane
proteins
that
are
necessary
for
the
normal
development
of
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
.

While
many
studies
highlight
the
significance
of
teneurins
,
especially
during
development
,
there
is
only
limited
information
known
about
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
function
.

Previous
studies
have
shown
that
the
N
-
terminal
intracellular
domain
(
ICD
)
of
teneurins
can
be
cleaved
at
the
membrane
and
subsequently
translocates
to
the
nucleus
where
it
can
influence
gene
transcription
.

Target
genes
as
well
as
mechanisms
have
yet
to
be
elucidated
,
and
thus
we
are
investigating
the
transcriptional
activity
of
the
human
teneurin-1
ICD
in
this
study
.

For
the
whole
transcriptome
analysis
of
TEN1
-
ICD
overexpression
,
we
used
a
modified
and
improved
tet
-
system
.

Two
separate
vectors
are
required
to
make
the
cell
line
stable
.

One
contains
the
tet
-
activating
domain
fused
to
a
glucocorticoid
binding
domain
(
GBD
)
.

The
other
contains
the
tetO
operator
sequences
directly
upstream
of
a
CMV
promoter
and
the
gene
to
be
overexpressed
.

BS149
cells
were
first
transfected
with
pirtetR
-
GBD
and
made
stable
by
Puromycin
selection
,
and
then
after
further
transfection
with
either
ptetO
-
eGFP
-
His
(
negative

)
or
ptetO
-
TEN1
-
ICD
-
eGFP
-
His
by

.

The
stable
BS149
cell
lines
were
split
into
three
10
cm
Petri
dishes
each
.

The
triplicate
cell
lines
were
cultured
once
before

with
Dexamethasone
and
Doxycycline
.

The
overexpressing
cells
were
then
FACS

sorted
directly
into

Similarly
to

,
both
innate
host
factors
such
as
genetics
,
and
environmental

including
the

have
been
implicated
in

In
this
study
,
we
make
use
of
the
IPAA
model
of
inflammatory

disease
(
IBD
)
to
carry
out
a
study
associating
mucosal
host

with
the

and
corresponding

.

In
order
to
determine
how
host
gene
expression
might
influence
,
or
be
influenced
by
the
tissue

,
we
analyzed
205

patients
with
biopsies
collected
from
the
pouch
and

Metadata
included

To
achieve
power
for
a

,
we
used

to
reduce
OTUs

to
eigengenes

explaining
50

These
were
subsequently

was
used
to

.

A

was
also
made
.

Mucosal

were
harvested
at
four

CpG
methylation
in
promoters
is
an

modification
,
which
regulates
gene
transcription
.

Using

,
we
examined
methylation
of
2100
genes
(

CpG
)
mapped
by
deep

to
T
cell

in

cells
.

466
CpGs
(
132
genes
)
displayed
differential
methylation
between
na‚Ä¢ve
and
memory
cells
.

21
genes
exhibited
both
differential
methylation
and
gene
expression
before
activation
,
linking
promoter
DNA
methylation
states
to
gene

;
6
genes
encode
proteins
closely
studied
in

while
15
genes
represent
novel

.

39
genes
exhibited
reduced
methylation
in

cells
coupled
with
increased

compared
to
na‚Ä¢ve

,
revealing
specific
genes
more
rapidly

.

These

We
have
compared
the
proteome
,
transcriptome
and
metabolome
of
two
isogenic
cell
lines
:
MCF-10A
,
derived
from
human
breast
epithelium
,
and
the
mutant
MCF-10A
-
H1047R.
These
cell
lines
differ
by
a
single
amino
acid
substitution
(
H1047R
)
caused
by
single
nucleotide
change
in
one
allele
of
the
PIK3CA
gene
which
encodes
the
catalytic
subunit
p110
_
of
phosphatidylinositol
3
-
kinase
(
PI3
K
)
.

The
H1047R
mutation
of
PIK3CA
is
one
of
the
most
frequently
encountered
somatic
cancer
-
specific
mutations
.

In
MCF-10A
,
this
mutation
induces
an
extensive
cellular
reorganization
that
far
exceeds
the
known
signaling
activities
of
PI3K.

The
changes
are
highly
diverse
;
with
examples
in
structural
protein
levels
,
the
DNA
repair
machinery
and
sterol
synthesis
.

Gene
set
enrichment
analysis
reveals
a
highly
significant
concordance
of
the
genes
differentially
expressed
in
MCF-10A
-
H1047R
cells
and
the
established
protein
and

signatures
of
basal

.

No
such
concordance
was
found
with
the

Somatic
mutations
in
the
spliceosome
gene
ZRSR2
(
located
on
the
X
chromosome
)
are
associated
with
myelodysplastic
syndrome
(
MDS
)
.

ZRSR2
is
involved
in
the
recognition
of
3
'
splice
site
during
the
early
stages
of
spliceosome
assembly
;
however
,
its
precise
role
in
RNA
splicing
has
remained
unclear
.

Here
,
we
characterize
ZRSR2
as
an
essential
component
of
the
minor
spliceosome
(
U12
-
dependent
)
assembly
.

shRNA
mediated
knockdown
of
ZRSR2
leads
to
impaired
splicing
of
the
U12
-
type
introns
,
and
RNA
-
Sequencing
of
MDS
bone
marrow
reveals
that
loss
of
ZRSR2
activity
causes
increased
mis
-
splicing
.

These
splicing
defects
involve
retention
of
the
U12
-
type
introns
while
splicing
of
the
U2
-
type
introns
remain
mostly
unaffected
.

ZRSR2
deficient
cells
also
exhibit
reduced
proliferation
potential
and
distinct
alterations
in
myeloid
and
erythroid
differentiation
in
vitro
.

These
data
identify
a
specific
role
for
ZRSR2
in
RNA
splicing
and
highlight
dysregulated
splicing
of
U12
-
type
introns
as
a
characteristic
feature
of
ZRSR2
mutations
in
MDS
.

RNA
sequencing
was
performed
on
16
bone
marrow
samples
(
MDS
and
normal
)
and
six
samples
of
control
or
ZRSR2
shRNA
transduced
TF-1
cells
and
data
was
analysed
for
aberrant
splicing
caused
by
ZRSR2
mutations
/
deficiency
.

We
have
compared
the
genome
-
wide
effects
on
the
transcriptome
after
treatment
with
ICG-001
(
the
specific
CBP
inhibitor
)
versus
C646
,
a
compound
that
competes
with
acetyl
-
coA
for
the
Lys
-
coA
binding
pocket
of
both
CBP
and
p300
.

We
found
that
both
drugs
cause
large
-
scale
changes
in
the
transcriptome
of
HCT116
colon
cancer
cells
and
PANC1
pancreatic
cancer
cells
,
and
reverse
some
tumor
-
specific
changes
in
gene
expression
.

Interestingly
,
although
the
epigenetic
inhibitors
affect
cell
cycle
pathways
in
both
the
colon
and
pancreatic
cancer
cell
lines
,
the
WNT
signaling
pathway
was
affected
only
in
the
colon
cancer
cells
.

Notably
,
WNT
target
genes
were
similarly
down
-
regulated
after
treatment
of
HCT116
with
C646
as
with
ICG-001
.

To
identify
genes
affected
by
direct
targeting
of
a
component
of
the
transcriptional
complex
implicated
in
WNT
regulation
,
we
used
siRNAs
to
knockdown

in
PANC1
cells
.

Cells
were
treated
with
control
siRNAs

siRNAs
specific
for
TCF7L2
and
RNA
was
analyzed
by

The
epithelium
lining
the
epididymis
in
the
male
reproductive
tract
maintains
a
luminal
environment
that
promotes
sperm
cell
maturation
.

This
process
is
dependent
on
the
coordinated
expression
of
many
genes
that
encode
proteins
with
a
role
in
epithelial
transport
.

We
previously
generated
genome
-
wide
maps
of
open
chromatin
in
primary
human
fetal
epididymis
epithelial
cells
to
identify
potential
regulatory
elements
controlling
coordinated
gene
expression
in
the
epididymis
epithelium
.

Subsequent
in
silico
analysis
identified
transcription
factor
binding
sites
(
TFBS
)
that
were
over
-
represented
in
the
HEE
open
chromatin
,
include
the
motif
for
paired
box
2
(
PAX2
)
.

PAX2
is
a
critical
transcriptional
regulator
of
urogenital
tract
development
,
which
is
well
studied
in
the
kidney
but
is
unexplored
in
the
epididymis
.

Due
to
the
limited
lifespan
of
primary
HEE
cells
in
culture
we
investigated
the
role
of
PAX2
in
an
immortalized
HEE
cell
line
(
REP
)
.

First
,
REP
cells
were
evaluated
by
DNase
-
seq
and
their
open
chromatin
map
overlapped
that
of
primary
HEE
cells
at
~
65
%
of
sites
.

Moreover
,
the
PAX2
-
binding
motif
was
again
identified
as
an
overrepresented
TFBS
within
intergenic
open
chromatin
,
though
on
fewer
chromosomes
than
in
the
primary
HEE
cells
.

To
identify
PAX2
-
target
genes
in
REP
cells
,
RNA
-
seq
analysis
was
performed
after
siRNA
-
mediated
depletion
of
PAX2
in
comparison
to
a
non
-
targeting
siRNA
.

In
response
to
PAX2
-
represssion
,
3142
transcripts
were
differentially
expressed
(
1334
up
-
regulated
and
1808
down
-
regulated
)
.

Novel
PAX2
targets
included
multiple
genes
encoding
proteins
with
a
predicted
function
in
the
epididymis
epithelium
.

compared
whole

signatures
of
6
immune
cell
subsets
and
whole
blood
from
patients
with
an
array
of
immune

Fresh

samples
were
collected
from
healthy

and
subjects
diagnosed

,
and

,
as
well
as
multiple
sclerosis
patients
before
and
24
hours
after
the
first
treatment
with
IFN

beta
.

At
the
time
of
blood
draw
,
an
aliquot
of
whole
blood
was
collected
into
a
Tempus
tube
(
Invitrogen
)
,
while
the
remainder
of
the
primary
fresh

sample
was
processed
to
highly

populations
of
neutrophils
,
monocytes
,
B

,

,
and

.

RNA
was
extracted
from
each
of
these

,
as
well
as
the
whole
blood
samples
,
and
processed
into
RNA

.

Sequencing

were
analyzed
on
an

.

Reads
were
demultiplexed
,
mapped
to
human

)
,
and
tabulated
using

Read

Background
:
Sepsis
,
a
leading
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
,
is
not
a
homogeneous
disease
but
rather
a
syndrome
encompassing
many
heterogeneous
pathophysiologies
.

Patient
factors
including
genetics
predispose
to
poor
outcomes
,
though
current
clinical
characterizations
fail
to
identify
those
at
greatest
risk
of
progression
and
mortality
.

Results
:
The
Community
Acquired
Pneumonia
and
Sepsis
Outcome
Diagnostic
study
enrolled
1,152
subjects
with
suspected
sepsis
.

We
sequenced
peripheral
blood
RNA
of
129
representative
subjects
with
systemic
inflammatory
response
syndrome
(
SIRS
)
or
sepsis
(
infection
with
SIRS
)
,
including
78
sepsis
survivors
and
28
sepsis
nonsurvivors
,
who
had
previously
undergone
plasma
proteomic
and
metabolomic
profiling
.

The
expression
of
338
genes
differed
between
subjects
with
SIRS
and
those
with
sepsis
,
primarily
reflective
of
immune
activation
in
sepsis
.

The
expression
of
1,238
genes
differed
with
sepsis
outcome
:
Nonsurvivors
had
lower
expression
of
many
immune
function
-
related
genes
.

Functional
genetic
variants
associated
with
sepsis
mortality
were
sought
based
on
a
common
disease
–†
rare
variant
hypothesis
.

VPS9D1
,
whose
expression
was
increased
in
sepsis
survivors
,
had
a
higher
burden
of
missense
variants
in
sepsis
survivors
,
and
these
were
associated
with
altered
expression
of
3,799
genes
,
primarily
reflecting
Golgi
and
endosome
biology
.

Conclusions
:
Host
response
in
sepsis
survivors
–†
activation
of
immune
response
-
related
genes
–†
was
muted
in
sepsis
nonsurvivors
.

The
association
of
sepsis
survival
with
robust
immune
response
and
presence
of
missense
variants
in
VPS9D1
warrants
replication
and
further
functional
studies
.

We
sequenced
peripheral

of
129
representative

,
who
had
previously
undergone

.

These
paired
HCC
and
non
-
tumorous
liver
tissues
were
used
to
determine
highly
differentially
expressed
genes
in
HCC
and
non
-
tumorous
liver
tissue
.

Hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
is
a
malignancy
with
poor
survival
outcome
.

Genes
showing
extreme
differential
expression
between
paired
human
HCC
and
adjacent
non
-
tumorous
liver
tissue
were
investigated
.

PLVAP
was
identified
as
a
gene
specifically
expressed
in
vascular
endothelial
cells
of
HCC
but
not
in
non
-
tumorous
liver
tissues
.

This
finding
was
confirmed
by
RT
-
PCR
analysis
of
micro
-
dissected
cells
and
immunohistochemical
staining
of
tissue
sections
.

A
recombinant
monoclonal
anti
-
PLVAP
Fab
fragment
co
-
expressing
extracellular
domain
of
human
tissue
factor
(
TF
)
was
developed
.

The
potential
therapeutic
effect
and
toxicity
to
treat
HCC
were
studied
using
a
Hep3B
HCC
xenograft
model
in
SCID
mice
.

Infusion
of
recombinant
monoclonal
anti
-
PLVAP
Fab
-
TF
into
the
tumor
feeding
artery
induced
tumor
vascular
thrombosis
and
extensive
tumor
necrosis
at
doses
between
2.5
¬µg
and
12
¬µg
.

Tumor
growth
was
suppressed
for
40
days
after
a
single
treatment
.

Systemic
administration
did
not
induce
tumor
necrosis
.

Little
systemic
toxicity
was
noted
for
this
therapeutic
agent
.

The
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
anti
-
PLVAP
Fab
-
TF
may
be
used
to
treat
HCC
cases
for
which
transcatheter
arterial
chemoembolization
(
TACE
)
is
currently
used
,
but
without
major
drawbacks
of
TACE
.

Anti
-
PLVAP
Fab
-
TF
may
improve
therapeutic
outcome
and
be
a
viable
therapeutic
agent
in
patients
with
more
advanced
disease
and
compromised
liver
function
.

Polycomb
Repressive
Complex
2
(
PRC2
)
plays
crucial
roles
in
transcriptional
regulation
and
stem
cell
development
.

However
,
the
context
-
specific
functions
associated
with
alternative
subunits
remain
largely
unexplored
.

Here
we
show
that
the
related
enzymatic
subunits
EZH1
and
EZH2
undergo
an
expression
switch
during
hematopoiesis
.

We
examine
the
in
vivo
stoichiometry
of
the
PRC2
complexes
by
quantitative
proteomics
and
reveal
the
existence
of
an
EZH1
-
SUZ12
sub
-
complex
lacking
EED
.

We
provide
evidence
that
EZH1
together
with
SUZ12
form
a
non
-
canonical
PRC2
complex
,
occupy
active
chromatin
domains
in
the
absence
of
H3K27me3
,
and
positively
regulate
gene
expression
.

Loss
of
EZH2
expression
leads
to
global
repositioning
of
EZH1
chromatin
occupancy
to
EZH2
targets
.

Moreover
,
we
demonstrate
that
an
erythroid
-
specific
enhancer
mediates
transcriptional
activation
of
EZH1
,
and
a
switch
from
GATA2
to
GATA1
controls
the
developmental
EZH1/2
switch
by
differential
association
with
EZH1
enhancers
during
erythropoiesis
.

Thus
,
the
lineage-
and
developmental
stage
-
specific
regulation
of
PRC2
expression
and
subunit
composition
leads
to
a
switch
from
canonical
silencing
to
non
-
canonical
PRC2
functions
during
blood
stem
cell
specification
.

We
used
microarrays
to
identify

for

We
performed

The
molecular
mechanisms
whereby
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
induces
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
remain
elusive
.

We
used
genomic
and
molecular
techniques
to
investigate
host
-
virus
interactions
by
mapping
the
entire
liver
of
patients
with
HCC
.

We
compared
the
gene
signature
of
whole
liver
tissue
(
WLT
)
versus
laser
capture
-
microdissected
(
LCM
)
hepatocytes
with
intrahepatic
expression
of
HBV
.

Gene
expression
profiling
was
performed
on
up
to
17
WLT
specimens
obtained
at
various
distances
from
the
tumor
center
in
individual
livers
of
11
patients
with
HCC
and
on
selected
LCM
samples
.

HBV
biomarkers
were
determined
by
real
-
time
PCR
and
confocal
immunofluorescence
.

Analysis
of
5
areas
of
the
liver
showed
a
sharp
change
in
gene
expression
between
the
immediate
perilesional
area
and
tumor
periphery
that
correlated
with
a
significant
decrease
in
the
intrahepatic
expression
of
HBsAg
.

The
tumor
was
characterized
by
a
large
preponderance
of
down
-
regulated
genes
,
mostly
involved
in
the
metabolism
of
lipid
and
fatty
acid
,
glucose
,
amino
acids
and
drugs
,
with
down
-
regulation
of
pathways
involved
in
the
activation
of
PXR
/
RXR
and
PPARa
/
RXRa
nuclear
receptors
,
comprising
PGC1
and
FOXO1
,
two
key
regulators
of
the
hepatic
metabolic
functions
and
HBV
transcription
.

These
findings
were
confirmed
by
gene
expression
of
microdissected
hepatocytes
.

However
,
LCM
of
malignant
hepatocytes
also
revealed
up
-
regulation
of
unique
genes
associated
with
cancer
and
signaling
pathways
,
including
two
novel
HCC
-
associated
cancer
testis
antigen
(
CTA
)
genes
,
NUF2
and
TTK
.

HCC
-
associated
with
HBV
is
characterized
by
a
metabolism
switch
-
off
and
by
a
significant
reduction
in
HBsAg
.

LCM
proved
to
be
a
critical
tool
to
validate
gene
signatures
associated
with
HCC
and
to
identify
genes
that
may
play
a
role
in
hepatocarcinogenesis
opening
new
perspectives
for
the
discovery
of
novel
diagnostic
markers
and
therapeutic
targets
.

Samples
were
obtained
at
various
distances
from
the
tumor
center
in
individual
livers
of
11
patients
with

.

Whole

samples
were
compared
to

obtained
from
the

We
identified
182

53
were

To
evaluate
gene
expression
profiles
in
intestinal
epithelial
cells
(

after
OSM
stimulation
,
we
have
employed
whole

microarray
expression
profiling
as
a
discovery
platform
to
identify
relevant
genes
which
are
potentially
of
interest
to
reveal
the
role
of
OSM
in
intestinal
inflammation
.

 
The
most
strongly
up

regulated
genes
were
SERPINS
,
which
belong
to
the
family
of
serin
peptidase
inhibitors
with
antiprotease
activities
,
most
of
them
serine
and
cysteine
proteases
.

SERPINB4
,
SERPINB3
and
SERPINA3
were
the
genes
with
the
strongest
up
-
regulation
,
also
verified
in
qPCR
.

OSM

induced
SERPIN
up

may
contribute
to
anti

apoptotic
and
proliferative
effects
of
OSM
in

On

,
cells
were
stimulated
in
quadruplicates
with

OSM
or

RNA
was
isolated
6

was
measured
.

The
alarmins
myeloid
-
related
protein
(
MRP
)
8
and
MRP14
are
the
dominant
cytoplasmic
proteins
in
phagocytes
.

After
release
by
activated
phagocytes
extracellular
MRP8
/
MRP14
complexes
promote
inflammation
in
many
diseases
,
including
infections
,
allergies
,
autoimmune
diseases
,
rheumatoid
arthritis
or
inflammatory

disease
.

As
receptors
for
the
pro
-
inflammatory
effects
of
human
MRP8
,
the
active
component
of
the
MRP8
/
MRP14
-
complex
,
Toll
-
like
receptor
(
TLR
)
4
and
the
multi
-
ligand
receptor
of
advanced
glycation
end

(
RAGE
)
are
controversial
discussed
.

Using
a
comparative
bioinformatics
analysis
between
genome
-
wide
response
patterns
of
monocytes
to
MRP8
,
endotoxin
and
different
cytokines
we
demonstrated
a
dominant
role
of
TLR4
during
MRP8
-
mediated
phagocyte
activation
.

The
relevance
of
this
signaling
pathway
could
be
confirmed
in
independent
cell
models
for
TLR4
and
RAGE
dependent
signaling
in
mouse
and
man
.

In
addition
to
well
-
known
proinflammatory
functions
of
MRP8
our
systems
biology
approach
unraveled
a
novel
anti
-
apoptotic
effect
of
MRP8
on
monocytes
which
was
confirmed
in
independent
functional
experiments
.

Our
data
define
the
dominance
of
the
TLR4
-
MRP8
axis
in
activation
of
human
phagocytes
which
represents
a
novel
attractive
target
for
modulation
of
overwhelming
innate
immune
responses
.

We
used
microarrays
to
detail
the
global
programme
of
gene
expression
underlying
cellularisation
and
identified
distinct
classes
of
up

regulated
genes
during
this
process
.

Human
blood
monocyte
stimulated
with
various
stimuli
(
control
,
MRP8
,
LPS
,
TNF
,
IL1
)
were
selected
for

extraction
and
hybridization
on
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

Atopic
dermatitis
(

is
the
most
common
inflammatory
skin
disease
,
with
high
unmet
need
for
new

that
are
safe
for
chronic

.

Emerging
data

Amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
(
ALS
)
is
a
paralytic
degenerative
disease
of
the
nervous
system
.

In
the
SOD1
mouse
model
of
ALS
we
found
loss
of
the
molecular
and
functional
microglia
signature
associated
with
pronounced
expression
of
miR-155
in
SOD1
mice
.

We
also
found
increased
expression
of
miR-155
in
the
spinal
cord
of
ALS
subjects
.

Genetic
ablation
of
miR-155
increased
survival
in
SOD1
mice
and
reversed
the
abnormal
microglial
and
monocyte
molecular
signature
.

In

,
dysregulated
proteins
in

of

mice
that
we
identified
in
human
ALS
spinal
cords
and

were
restored

.

Treatment
of

mice
with

mice
injected
systemically
or
into
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
prolonged
survival
and
restored
the
microglial
unique
genetic

.

Our
findings
provide
a
new
avenue
for
immune

therapy
of

by
targeting

.

The
splicing
factor
SF3B1
is
the
most
commonly
mutated
gene
in
the
myelodysplastic
syndromes
(
MDS
)
,
particularly
in
patients
with
refractory
anemia
with
ring
sideroblasts
(
RARS
)
.

MDS
is
a
disorder
of
the
hematopoietic
stem
cell
and
we
thus
studied
the
transcriptome
of
CD34
+
cells
from
MDS
patients
with
SF3B1
mutations
using
RNA
-
sequencing
.

Genes
significantly
differentially
expressed
at
the
transcript
and/or
exon
level
in
SF3B1
mutant
compared
to
wildtype
cases
include
genes
involved
in
MDS
pathogenesis
(
ASXL1
,
CBL
)
,
iron
homeostasis
and
mitochondrial
metabolism
(
ALAS2
,
ABCB7
,
SLC25A37
)
and
RNA
splicing
/
processing
(
PRPF8
,
HNRNPD
)
.

Many
genes
regulated
by
a
DNA
damage
-
induced
BRCA1
-
BCLAF1
-
SF3B1
protein
complex
showed
differential
expression
/
splicing
in
SF3B1
mutant
cases
.

Our
data
indicate
that
SF3B1
plays
a
critical
role
in
MDS
by
affecting
the
expression
and
splicing
of
genes
involved
in
specific
cellular
processes
/
pathways
,
many
of
which
are
relevant
to
the
known
RARS
pathophysiology
,
suggesting
a
causal
link
.

was
performed
to
compare
the
transcriptome
of
bone

CD34

cells
from
eight
MDS
patients
with

mutation
,
four
MDS
patients
with
no
known

and
five
healthy

.

Human
diffuse
intrinsic
pontine
gliomas
(
DIPG
)
are
an
aggressive
form
of
pediatric
brain
tumors
that
arise
in
the
pons
in
young
children
thus
resulting
in
significant
morbidity
and
very
poor
survival
.

Recent
data
suggest
that
mutations
in
the
histone
H3.3
variant
are
often
found
in
these
tumors
,
though
the
mechanism
of
their
contribution
to
oncogenesis
remains
to
be
elucidated
.

Here
we
report
that
the
combination
of
constitutive
PDGFRA
activation
and
p53
suppression
as
well
as
expression
of
the
K27
M
mutant
form
of
the
histone
H3.3
variant
leads
to
neoplastic
transformation
of
hPSC
-
derived
neural
precursors
.

Our
study
demonstrates
that
human
ES
cells
represent
an
excellent
platform
for
the
modeling
of
human
tumors
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
which
could
potentially
lead
to
the
elucidation
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
neoplastic
transformation
and
the
identification
of
novel
therapeutic
targets
.

Human
ES
cells
were
differentiated
to
NPCs
and
lentivirally
transduced
with
a
combination
of
constitutively
active
PDGFRA
(
D842V
)
,
sh
-
p53
,
and
WT
or
K27
M
mutant
form
of
histone
H3.3
variant
.

We
performed
a
biological
and
molecular
characterization
of
the
novel
human
multiple
myeloma
cell
line
CMA03/06
,
an
IL-6
-
independent
variant
of
CMA03
cell
line
 
previously
established
in
our
Institution
.

We
showed
that
the
CMA03/06
cells
grows
in
the
absence
of
IL-6
with
a
doubling
time
comparable
to
CMA03
;
the
addition
of
IL-6
to
the
culture
medium
or
co
-
culture
with
multipotent
mesenchymal
stromal
cells
does
not
induce
an
increase
in
proliferation
rate
.

Interestingly
,
we
provided
evidence
that
IL-6
independence
of
CMA03/06
cells
is
not
a
consequence
of
the
development
of
an
autocrine
IL-6
loop
,
even
though
the
cells
maintain
the
IL-6
signaling
pathway
responsiveness
as
demonstrated
by
STAT1
and
STAT3
induction
by
IL-6
.

A
slight
constitutive
activation
of
STAT3
has
been
observed
in
CMA03/06
cell
line
;
however
STAT3
silencing
in
CMA03/06
cells
did
not
affect
their
viability
and
proliferation
suggesting
that
this
pathway
is
not
the
only
responsible
for
the
IL-6
independency
of
CMA03/06
cell
line
.

The
new
cell
line
showed
a
lower
susceptibility
to
camptothecin
-
induced
apoptosis
compared
to
CMA03
cells
,
whereas
an
increased
induction
of
apoptosis
was
observed
in
CMA03/06
cell
line
after
Bortezomib
treatment
which
may
suggest
the
involvement
NF
-
kB
pathway
in
the
IL-6
independent
growth
and
survival
of
CMA03/06
cells
.

Finally
,
global
gene
expression
profiling
analysis
allowed
the
identification
of
a
list
of
308
modulated
genes
in
CMA03/06
versus
CMA03
cells
,
many
of
which
particularly
relevant
for
MM
biology
.

Overall
,
the
novel
CMA03/06
cell
line
may
represent
a
suitable
model
for
studies
investigating
molecular
mechanisms
involved
in
clonal
evolution
towards
IL-6
and/or
stroma
-
independent
growth
and
survival
of
myeloma
cells
.

The
fragile
X
mental
retardation
protein
FMRP
is
an
RNA
binding
protein
that
regulates
translation
of
its
bound
mRNAs
through
incompletely
defined
mechanisms
.

FMRP
has
been
linked
to
the
microRNA
pathway
and
we
show
here
that
it
is
associated
with
MOV10
,
a
putative
helicase
that
is
also
associated
with
the
microRNA
pathway
.

 
We
show
that
FMRP
associates
with
MOV10
in
an
RNA
-
dependent
manner
and
facilitates
MOV10
-
association
with
RNAs
in
brain
.

We
identified
the
RNA
sequences
recognized
by
MOV10
using
iCLIP
and
found
an
increased
number
of
G
-
quadruplexes
in
the
CLIP
sites
.

We
provide
evidence
that
MOV10
facilitates
microRNA
-
mediated
translation
regulation
and
also
has
the
novel
role
of
increasing
the
expression
of
a
subset
of
RNAs
by
sterically
hindering
Argonaute2
association
.

In
summary
,
we
have
identified
a
new
mechanism
for
FMRP

translational
regulation
through
its
association
with

Background
:
Our
recent
studies
strongly
suggest
that
remodeling
in
the
control
of
gene

contributes
to
the
progression
of

associated
to
the

have
been
focused
on

of

using

that

as

generated
a

Conclusions
:
Taken
together
,
our
observations
point
out
towards
an
inhibitory
role
of
TIA
proteins
in
cell
proliferation

growth
,
there
appears
to
be
an

molecular
discrepancy
regarding
the
effects
of

on
whether
the
proteins
are
depleted

Constitutive
activation
of
EGFR-
and
NF
-
kB
-
dependent
pathways
is
a
hallmark
of
cancer
,
yet
signaling
proteins
that
connect
both
oncogenic
cascades
are
poorly
characterized
.

Here
we
define
KIAA1199
as
a
BCL-3-
and
p65
-
dependent
gene
in
transformed
keratinocytes
.

KIAA1199
expression
is
enhanced
upon
human
papillomavirus
(
HPV
)
infection
and
is
aberrantly
expressed
in
clinical
cases
of
cervical
(
pre)neoplastic
lesions
.

Mechanistically
,
KIAA1199
binds
Plexin
A2
and
protects
from
Semaphorin
3A
-
mediated
cell
death
by
promoting
EGFR
stability
and
signaling
.

Moreover
,
KIAA1199
is
an
EGFR
-
binding
protein
and
KIAA1199
deficiency
impairs
EGF
-
dependent
Src
,
MEK1
and
ERK1/2
phosphorylations
.

Therefore
,
EGFR
stability
and
signaling
to
downstream
kinases
requires
KIAA1199
.

As
such
,
KIAA1199
promotes
EGF
-
mediated
epithelial
-
mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
.

Taken
together
,
our
data
define
KIAA1199
as
an
oncogenic
protein
induced
by
HPV
infection
and
constitutive
NF
-
kB
activity
that
transmits
pro
-
survival
and
invasive
signals
through
EGFR
signaling
.

We
used
microarrays
to

infected
with
a

as
well
as
HaCat

infected
with
a

was
performed
in

patients
with

and
in
four
healthy
controls
,
along
with
bioinformatics
analysis
of
retrieved

(

)
.

Total

was
isolated
from
whole

of
45
children
with
known

and
diagnosis
of

according
to

of

,
as
well
as

matched

participants
without

.

Of
those

patient
and

The
rising
incidence
of
obesity
and
related
disorders
such
as
diabetes
and
heart
disease
has
 
focused
considerable
attention
on
the
discovery
of
novel
therapeutics
.

One
promising
 
approach
has
been
to
increase
the
number
or
activity
of
brown
-
like
adipocytes
in
white
 
adipose
depots
,
as
this
has
been
shown
to
prevent
diet
-
induced
obesity
and
reduce
the
 
incidence
and
severity
of
type
2
diabetes
.

Thus
,
the
conversion
of
fat
-
storing
cells
into
 
metabolically
active
thermogenic
cells
has
become
an
appealing
therapeutic
strategy
to
 
combat
obesity
.

Here
,
we
report
a
screening
platform
for
the
identification
of
small
molecules
 
capable
of
promoting
a
white
-
to
-
brown
metabolic
conversion
in
human
adipocytes
.

We
 
identified
two
inhibitors
of
Janus
Kinase
(
JAK
)
activity
with
no
precedent
in
adipose
tissue
 
biology
that
permanently
confer
brown
-
like
metabolic
activity
to
white
adipocytes
.

 
Importantly
,
these
metabolically
converted
adipocytes
exhibit
elevated
UCP1
expression
and
 
increased
mitochondrial
activity
.

We
further
found
that
repression
of
interferon
signalling
and
 
activation
of
hedgehog
signalling
in
JAK
-
inactivated
adipocytes
contributes
to
the
metabolic
 
conversion
observed
in
these
cells
.

Our
findings
highlight
a
novel
role
for
the
JAK
/
STAT
 
pathway
in
the
control
of
adipocyte
function
and
establish
a
platform
to
identify
compounds
 
for
the
treatment
of
obesity
.

were

,
and

respectively
.

Transcriptomic

was
performed
at
24
hours
and
7

respectively
.

Three
biological

are
available
for

The
endometrial
perivascular
microenvironment
is
rich
in
mesenchymal
stem
-
like
cells
that
express
type
1
integral

Sushi
domain
containing

(
SUSD2
)
but
the
role
of
these
cells
in
the
decidual
transformation
of
this
tissue
in
pregnancy
is
unknown
.

We
used
an
antibody
directed
against
SUSD2
(
W5C5
)
to
isolate
perivascular
(
W5C5
+
)
and
non
-
perivascular
(
W5C5-
)
fibroblasts
from
mid
-
luteal
biopsies
.

We
show
that
SUSD2
expression
,
and
hence
the
ratio
of
W5C5
+
to
W5C5-
cells
,
changes
in
culture
depending
on
cell
-
cell
contact
and
activation
of
the
Notch
signaling
pathway
.

RNA
sequencing
revealed
that
cultures
derived
from
W5C5
+
progenitor
cells
remain
phenotypically
distinct
by
the
enrichment
of
novel
and
established
endometrial
perivascular
signature
genes
.

In
an
undifferentiated
state
,
W5C5
+
-derived
cells
produced
lower
levels
of
various
chemokines
and
inflammatory
modulators
when
compared
to
their
W5C5-
counterparts
.

This
divergence
in
secretomes
became
more
pronounced
upon
decidualization
,
which
transformed
perivascular
W5C5
+
cells
into
the
dominant
source
of
a
range
of
trophic
and
immunomodulatory
cytokines
,
including
leukemia
inhibitory
factor
(
LIF
)
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
the
decidual
response
is
spatially
organized
with
differentiating
perivascular
cells
establishing
distinct
cytokine
and
chemokine
gradients
that
could
direct
trophoblast
towards
maternal
vessels
and
govern
local
immune
responses
in
pregnancy
.

Aging

Aging
is
a
multifactorial
process
where
the
impact
of
singular
components
still
remains
unclear
.

Furthermore
,
previous
studies
were
focused
on
measuring
specific
traits
such
as
DNA
-methylation
and
used
categorical
group

wise
designs
,
unable
to

.

Here
we
have
developed
a
new
method
for
a
longitudinal
,
age
-
related
analysis
combining
the
merits
of
a
pair
-
wise
design
with
the
statistical
power
of
gene
set
enrichment
analysis
.

We
present
an
integrated
analysis
,
including
transcriptional
changes
and
genome
-
wide
epigenetic
changes
in
DNA-
methylation
,
H3K4-
and
H3K27-
histone

in

.

 
We
tested
our
method
on
a
rare
collection
of
paired
skin
fibroblast
samples
from
male
middle
age
to
old
age
transitions
and
obtained
functional

clusters
.

By
using
a

individuals
,
we
could
demonstrate
a
high
overlap
of
functional
terms
to
previously
established
tissue
-
independent
age
signatures
including
extracellular
matrix
,
apoptosis
and
oxidative

.

Importantly
,
we
identify
protein

as
the
main
cluster
of

The

However
,

,
sug-
gesting
that
this
complex
plays
a
dichotomous
and
poorly

role
in
cancer2,3
.

Here
we
provide
genomic

data
demonstrating
that

as
tumour
suppressor
in
PNS
tumours
,
high
-
grade
gliomas
and
melanomas
by
cooperating
with
mutations
in
NF1
.

NF1
encodes
a
Ras
GTPase
-
activating
protein
(
RasGAP
)
and
its
loss
drives
cancer
by
activating
Ras4
.

We
show
that
SUZ12
loss
potentiates
the
effects
of
NF1
mutations
by
amplifying
Ras
-
driven
transcription
through
effects
on
chromatin
.

Importantly
,
however
,
SUZ12
inactivation
also
triggers
an
epigenetic
switch
that
sensitizes
these
cancers
to
bromodomain
inhib-
itors
.

Collectively
,
these
studies
not
only
reveal
an
unexpected
con-
nection
between
the
PRC2
complex
,
NF1
and
Ras
,
but
also
identify
a
promising

helped

Ovarian
cancer
is
the
fifth
most
common
form
of
cancer
in
women
in
the
United
States
.

Among
different
types
of
ovarian
cancer
,
epithelial
ovarian
cancer
is
the
most
common
and
is
highly
lethal
,
however
,
prognostic
and
predictive
markers
,
which
can
be
used
to
predict
chemoresponse
and
patient
survival
,
have
not
been
thoroughly
explored
.

One
critically
important
yet
often
overlooked
component
to
the
tumor
progression
process
is
the
tumor
microenvironment
.

Primarily
composed
of
fibroblasts
and
extracellular
matrix
proteins
(
ECM
)
as
well
as
endothelial
cells
and
lymphocytic
infiltrate
,
the
tumor
microenvironment
has
been
shown
to
directly
affect
cell
growth
,
migration
,
and
differentiation
through
secreted
proteins
,
cell
-
cell
interactions
and
matrix
remodeling
(
Tlsty
and
Coussens
,
2006
)
.

The
tumor
microenvironment
has
the
potential
to
promote
tumor
initiation
of
normal
epithelial
cells
and
facilitate
progression
of
malignant
cells
,
thereby
,
presenting
a
unique
approach
to
diagnosing
,
understanding
and
treating
cancer
.

Using
a

platform
to
perform

on
the
fibroblastic
stromal
component
microdissected
from
a
series
of
advanced

grade
serous
ovarian
adenocarcinomas
,
we
identified
a
transcriptome
signature
for
the
ovarian
cancer
associated
fibroblast
(
CAF
)
.

We
further
functionally
characterized
one
of
the
identified
genes
,
MFAP5
,
and
we
showed
that
stromal
MFAP5
is
a
prognostic
marker
associated
with
poor
patient
survival
.

In
addition
to
that
,
to
investigate
the
signaling
machanism
and
the
effect
of
MFAP5
treatment
on
ovarian
cancer
cells
,
transcriptome
profiling
of
MFAP5
treated
OVCA432
high
-
grade
serous
ovarian
cancer
cells
was
performed
.

Further
functional
studies
showed
that
stromal
MFAP5
modulated
ovarian
cancer
cell
motility
and
invasion
potential
.

High
grade
serous
ovarian
cancer
cell

OVCA432
was
used
.

Total

was
isolated

at
48
hours
post

,
samples
were
then
hybridized

Advances
in
cellular
reprogramming
and
stem
cell
differentiation
now
enable
ex

studies
of
human
neuronal
differentiation
.

However
,
it
remains
challenging
to
elucidate
the
underlying
regulatory
programs
because
differentiation
protocols
are
laborious
and
often
result
in
low
neuron
yields
.

Here
,
we
overexpressed
two
murine
Neurogenin
transcription
factors
in

pluripotent
stem
cells
,
and
obtained
neurons
with
bipolar
morphology
in
four
days
at
greater
than
90
%
purity
.

The
high
purity
enabled
mRNA
and
microRNA
expression
profiling
during
neurogenesis
,
thus
revealing
the
genetic
programs
involved
in
the
transition
from
stem
cell
to
neuron
.

These
profiles
were
then
analyzed
to
identify
the
regulatory
networks
underlying
the

of
the

demonstrate
the

and
the

in

,
indicating
that

The
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
obtain
comprehensive
gene

profiles
in
breast

.

Mammary

were
specifically
isolated
from

We
investigated
gene

in
417

Gene

were
acquired
using
GeneChip
Human

2.0
(

.

Microarray

were
normalized
and
transformed
to

values
using

(

method
with
R

software
and
BioConductor
package
.

The
histone
variant
macroH2A1
and
the
poly(ADP
-
ribose
)
polymerase
PARP-1
both
regulate
gene
transcription
by
modulating
chromatin
structure
and
function
.

Of
the
two
macroH2A1
splice
variants
,
macroH2A1.1
and
macroH2A1.2
,
the
former
is
often
suppressed
in
cancer
and
has
the
unique
ability
to
interact
with
poly(ADP
-
ribose
)
.

Using
ChIP
-
seq
in
primary
lung
fibroblasts
,
we
demonstrate
that
macroH2A1
is
incorporated
into
either
of
two
spatially
and
functionally
distinct
types
of
chromatin
;
the
first
is
marked
by
H3
K27
trimethylation
,
while
the
second
contains
a
set
of
nine
histone
acetylations
.

MacroH2A1
-
regulated
genes
are
involved
in
cancer
progression
are
specifically
found
in
macroH2A1
-
containing
acetylated
chromatin
.

Through
the
recruitment
of
PARP-1
,
macroH2A1.1
promotes
the
acetylation
of
H2B
K12
and
K120
which
plays
a
key
role
in
the
regulation
of
macroH2A1
target
genes
in
primary
cells
.

The
macroH2A1
/
PARP-1
pathway
regulating
H2B
K12
and
K120
acetylation
is
disrupted
in
cancer
cells
,
in
part
,
explaining
macroH2A1–•s
role
in
cancer
suppression
.

demonstrated
that

directly
binds
and
represses

receptors
S1pr1
and
Grp183
by
recruiting
Hdac2
through
the

.

 
Deregulation
of
these

and
may
contribute
to

Ovarian
cancer
is
the
most
lethal
malignancy
in
the
United
States
.

In
the
year
2012
,
there
will
be
an
estimated
22,280
new
cases
and
15,500
deaths
from
ovarian
cancer
in
the
country
(
Siegel
et
al
.
,
2012
)
.

While
studies
on
ovarian
cancer
pathogenesis
were
mainly
focused
on
the
epithelial
component
of
the
tumor
,
understanding
in
the
role
of
cancer
associated
fibroblasts
(
CAFs
)
in
ovarian
cancer
progression
is
limited
.

We
hypothesized
that
comparing
the
gene
expression
profiles
of
different
components
from
laser
capture
microdissected
ovarian
tissue
will
allow
us
to
identify
an
ovarian
CAFs
specific
gene
signature
which
accounts
for
the
supportive
role
of
CAFs
in
ovarian
cancer
progression
.

In
this
study
,
gene
expression
profiling
was
completed
for
31
cancer
stroma
samples
and
32
samples
of
epithelial
component
from
high
grade
serous
ovarian
cancer
patients
.

8
microdissected
normal
ovarian
stroma
and
6
normal
human
ovarian
surface
epithelium
(
HOSE
)
samples
were
also
included
in
the
study
.

By
comparing
the
expression
data
from
cancer
stroma
against
that
from
normal
stroma
,
cancer
cells
and
HOSE
,
we
identified
a
set
of
differential
expressed
genes
in
ovarian
CAFs
which
showed
correlation
with
cancer
patient
survival
.

Further
study
on
these
genes
can
reveal
their
roles
in
ovarian
cancer
progression
and
pathogenesis
.

Ultimately
,
ovarian
CAFs
specified
genes
identified
in
this
study
may
aid
in
the
classification
and
enhancement
of
patient
outcome
.

Transcriptome

analyses
were
performed
on

laser
microdissected
cancer
associated

samples
,
32
epithelial

samples
from
high
grade

ovarian
cancer
patients
,
8
microdissected
normal
ovarian

samples
and

ovarian
surface
epthelium
(
HOSE
)
samples
using
the
Affymetrix
human
genome
U133
Plus
2.0
microarray
.

We
compared
the
transcriptomic
content
of
salivary
exosomes
vs.
whole
saliva
via
microarray
(
Affymetrix
HU133
plus
2.0
)
.

Unstimulated
saliva
samples
and
derived
exosome
-
like
microvesicles
were
obtained
from
3
healthy
volunteers
and
processed
for
RNA
isolation
and
microarray
analysis
.

Inflammasomes
are
intracellular
innate
immune
sensors
that
respond
to
pathogen
and
damage
-
associated
signals
with
the
proteolytic
cleavage
of
caspase-1
,
resulting
in
IL-1
_
and
IL-18
secretion
and
macrophage
pyroptosis
.

The
discovery
that
heterozygous
gain
-
of
-
function
mutations
in
NLRP3
lead
to
oversecretion
of
IL-1
_
and
cause
the
autoinflammatory
disease
spectrum
Cryopyrin
Associated
Periodic
Syndrome
(
CAPS
)
,
led
to
the
successful
use
of
IL-1
blocking
therapies1
.

We
found
that
a
de
novo
missense
mutation
in
the
regulatory
domain
of
the
NLRC4
(
IPAF
,
CARD12
)
inflammasome
causes
early
-
onset
recurrent
fever
flares
and
Macrophage
Activation
Syndrome
(
MAS
)
.

Functional
analyses
demonstrated
spontaneous
production
of
the
inflammasome
-
dependent
cytokines
IL-1
_
and
IL-18
exceeding
levels
in
CAPS
patients
.

The
NLRC4
mutation
led
to
constitutive
caspase-1
cleavage
in
transduced
cells
and
enhanced
spontaneous
production
of
IL-18
by
both
patient
and
NLRC4
mutant
macrophages
.

Thus
,
we
describe
a
novel
monoallelic
inflammasome
defect
that
expands
the
autoinflammatory
paradigm
to
include
MAS
and
suggests
novel
targets
for
therapy
.

prior

and
the

Please
note
that
seven

are
chronologic

.

They
are
ordinal
,
in
that
"

was
drawn
before
"

"
,
but
the
distance
in
time
between

is
not
constant
.

Thus
,
time
points
4
through
7
correspond
to
samples
drawn
while
the
patient
was
well
AND
on
treatment
.

However
there
may
be
differences
between
4
and
7
pertaining
to
the
length
of
treatment
,
and
for
that
reason
any
of
these
samples
were
not
considered

Expansion
of
nanotechnology
will
bring
many
potential
benefits
as
adversely
effects
on
human
health
.

Protection
of
the
human
respiratory
system
from
exposure
of
volatile
nanoparticles
has
become
an
emerging
health
concern
.

The
understanding
of
the
biological
processes
involved
in
the
development
and
maintenance
of
a
variety
of
pathologies
is
improved
by
genome
-
wide
approaches
.

Technical
feasibility
of
this
type
of
experiment
has
perfected
in
recent
years
,
but
data
analysis
remains
challenging
.

In
this
context
,
gene
set
analysis
has
emerged
as
a
fundamental
tool
for
the
interpretation
of
the
results
.

We
demonstrate
how
the
use
of
a
combination
of
gene
-
by
-
gene
and
gene
set
analyses
can
enhance
the
interpretation
of
results
.

Gene
set
analyses
are
able
to
distinguish
responses
due
to
nanoparticle
size
also
discriminating
between
long
and
short
time
recovery
after
exposure
.

Transcription
regulation
and
cell
proliferation
modulation
appear
to
be
an
early
response
while
oxidative
stress
and
mitochondrial
perturbation
are
late
response
.

Moreover
,
smaller
the
particle
higher
the
effect
on
inflammatory
response
and
DNA
damage
activation
.

By
integrating
the
two
approaches
,
we
evidenced
the
importance
of
MMP1
,
MMP9
,
MMP7
and
MMP14
genes
in
response
to
Ludox–Å
silica
nanoparticles
and
the
involvement
apoptosis
process
in
cell
viability
.

This
study
is
based
on
the
treatment
of
A549
cells
with
two
different
silica
nanoparticles
(
SM30
,
9
nm
of
diameter
,
and
AS30
,
18
nm
of
diameter
)
.

Treatment
with
nanoparticles
were
performed
independently
.

We
performed
three
biological
replicates
for
each
condition
.

Three
transcription
factors
KLF5
,
GATA4
and
GATA6
are
recurrently
amplified
in
multiple
gastric
cancer
cohorts
,
representing
one
type
of
lineage
-
survival
oncogenes
in
gastric
cancer
.

ChIP
-
Seq
analysis
of
these
three
factors
in
multiple
cell
lines
revealed
that
significant
number
of
genomic
sites
are
co

occupied
by
KLF5
and
GATA4
and/or
GATA6
.

Integrative
analysis
of
ChIP

and
gene
expression
identified
several
targets
of
the
three
transcription
factors
in
both
cell
lines
and
primary
tumors
,
including
HNF4A.
These
results
suggest
that
KLF5
,
GATA4
and
GATA6
interact
and
co
-
operate
to
regulate
HNF4A
and
other
genes
to
promote
tumorigenesis
in

.

The
Sin3
/
HDAC
multi
-
protein
complex
consists
of
at
least
17
subunits
and
is
known
to
have
roles
in
diverse
biological
and
cellular
processes
including
transcription
,
chromatin
structure
,
and
the
cell
cycle
.

ING2
is
a
non
-
catalytic
component
of
this
complex
.

To
obtain
a
better
mechanistic
understanding
of
the
Sin3
/
HDAC
complex
in
cancer
,
we
extended
its
protein
-
protein
interaction
network
and
identified
a
mutually
exclusive
pair
within
the
complex
.

Suberoylanilide
hydroxamic
acid
(
SAHA
)
is
an
FDA
approved
HDAC
inhibitor
used
for
the
treatment
of
cutaneous
T
-
cell
lymphoma
.

We
assessed
the
effects
of
SAHA
on
the
disruption
of
the
complex
network
through
six
homologous
baits
.

SAHA
perturbs
multiple
protein
interactions
and
therefore
compromises
the
composition
of
large
parts
of
the
Sin3
/
HDAC
network
.

A
comparison
of
the
effect
of
SAHA
treatment
on
gene
expression
in
breast
cancer
cells
to
a
knockdown
of
the
ING2
subunit
indicated
that
a
portion
of
the
anticancer
effects
of
SAHA
may
be
attributed
to
the
disruption
of
ING2–•s
association
with
the
complex
.

ING2
siRNA
knockdowns
in
human
breast
cancer
cell
line
MDA
-
MB-231
were
compared
to
a
non
-
targeting
control
in
triplicate
,
for
a
total
of
6
samples
.

Intercellular
communication
is
critical
for
integrating
complex
signals
in
multicellular
eukaryotes
.

 
Vascular
endothelial
cells
and
T
lymphocytes
closely
interact
during
the
recirculation
and
trans
-
endothelial
migration
of
T
cells
.

 
In
addition
to
direct
cell
-
cell
contact
,
we
show
that
T
cell
derived
extracellular
vesicles
can
interact
with
endothelial
cells
and
modulate
their
cellular
functions
.

 
Thrombospondin-1
and
its
receptor
CD47
are
expressed
on
exosomes
/
ectosomes
derived
from
T
cells
,
and
these
extracellular
vesicles
are
internalized
and
modulate
signaling
in
both
T
cells
and
endothelial
cells
.

 
Extracellular
vesicles
released
from
cells
expressing
or
lacking
CD47
differentially
regulate
activation
of
T
cells
induced
by
engaging
the
T
cell
receptor
.

  
Similarly
,
T
cell
-
derived
extracellular
vesicles
modulate
endothelial
cell
responses
to
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
and
tube
formation
in
a
CD47
-
dependent
manner
.

Uptake
of
T
cell
derived
extracellular
vesicles
by
recipient
endothelial
cells
globally
alters
gene
expression
in
a
CD47
-
dependent
manner
.

CD47
also
regulates
the
mRNA
content
of
extracellular
vesicles
in
a
manner
consistent
with
some
of
the
resulting
alterations
in
target
endothelial
cell
gene
expression
.

Therefore
,
the
thrombospondin-1
receptor
CD47
directly
or
indirectly
regulates
intercellular
communication
mediated
by
the
transfer
of
extracellular
vesicles
between
vascular
cells
.

HuVEC
cells
were
cocultured
with
exosomes
derived
either
from
Jurkat
or
JinB8
cells
culture
media
.

Each
condition
was
done
in
triplicate
.

Also
,
Exosome
RNA
from
Jurkat
or
JINB8
cells
were
compared
to
each
other
in
triplicate
.

We
generated
H460
cells
with
acquired
TRAIL
resistance
by
exposing
the
parental
sentisitve
cells
to
subtoxic
concentrations
of
TRAIL
for
6
months
.

Then
we
compared
the
gene
expression
profile
of
the
sensitive
versus
the
resistant
cells
.

We
generated
acquired
TRAIL
-
resistant
H460
cells
from
the
sentisitve
cells
by
treating
subtoxic
range
of
TRAIL
for
6
month
.

And
we
tried
to
compare
the
expressional
profile
of
the
genes
between
two
cell
types
to
isolate
genes
regulating
acquired
TRAIL
-
resistance
H460
cells
were
treated
with
subtoxic
concentrations
of
TRAIL
for
6
month
.

After
confirmation
of
the
resistance
,
the
RNA
was
extracted
and
the
gene
expression
profile
was
analyzed
.

BS69
(
aka
ZMYND11
)
was
initially
discovered
as
a
direct
target
of
adenoviral
E1A
oncoprotein1
.

Subsequent
studies
implicated
BS69
as
a
tumor
suppressor
and
a
transcriptional
regulator2
.

But
exactly
how
BS69
regulates
gene
expression
has
remained
elusive
.

BS69
contains
tandemly
arranged
PHD
,
BROMO
and
PWWP
domains
,
which
are
known
to
function
as
chromatin
recognition
modalities
.

Here
we
show
that
BS69
selectively
recognizes
histone
variant
H3.3
lysine
36
trimethylation
(
H3.3K36me3
)
via
these
chromatin
recognition
modules
.

Using
a
proteomics
approach
,
we
further
identified
association
of
BS69
with
a
host
of
RNA
splicing
regulators
including
EFTUD2
and
other
U5
snRNP
components
of
the
spliceosome
.

Remarkably
,
RNA
-
seq
analysis
shows
that
BS69
mainly
regulates
intron
retention
(
IR
)
,
which
is
one
of
the
least
well
-
understood
RNA
alternative
splicing
events
in
mammalian
cells
.

Specifically
,
loss
of
BS69
results
in
a
decrease
in
IR
,
while
in
contrast
,
knockdown
of
EFTUD2
leads
to
an
increase
in
IR
,
consistent
with
its
role
as
a
core
member
of
the
splicesome
machinery
.

Importantly
,
wildtype
BS69
,
but
not
a
BS69
mutant
defective
in
its
interaction
with
EFTUD2
,
rescues
the
IR
events
.

We
also
show
that
knockdown
of
SETD2
,
the
main
enzyme
that
mediates
H3K36
trimethylation3
,
similarly
results
in
a
decreased
retention
of
the
same
introns
regulated
by
BS69
.

Significantly
,
a
BS69
mutant
unable
to
bind
H3.3K36me3
in
vitro
fails
to
rescue
the

associated
with

of

.

Taken
together
,
our
findings
identify
an
antagonistic
relationship
between
BS69
and
the
core
splicing
machinery
and
demonstrate
that
BS69
-
mediated
RNA
splicing
regulation
is
dependent
both
on
its
ability
to
bind
chromatin
decorated
by
H3K36me3
and
its
ability
to
physically
interact
with
the
core
spliceosome
machinery
.

Our
study
reveals
a
novel
and
unexpected
role
of
BS69
in
connecting
histone
H3.3K36
trimethylation
to
regulated
RNA
splicing
,
providing
significant
new
insights
into
chromatin
regulation
of

Background
:
The
recent
emergence
of
a
novel
coronavirus
in
the
Middle
East
(
designated
MERS
-
CoV
)
is
a
reminder
of
the
zoonotic
potential
of
coronaviruses
and
the
severe
disease
these
etiologic
agents
can
cause
in
humans
.

Clinical
features
of
Middle
East
respiratory
syndrome
(
MERS
)
include
severe
acute
pneumonia
and
renal
failure
that
is
highly
reminiscent
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
caused
by
SARS
-
CoV.

The
host
response
is
a
key
component
of
highly
pathogenic
respiratory
virus
infection
.

Here
,
we
computationally
analyzed
gene
expression
changes
in
a
human
airway
epithelial
cell
line
infected
with
two
genetically
distinct
MERS
-
CoV
strains
obtained
from
human
patients
,
MERS
-
CoV
-
EMC
(
designated
EMC
)
and
MERS
-
CoV
-
London
(
designated
LoCoV
)
.

  
Results
:
Using
topological
techniques
,
such
as
persistence
homology
and
filtered
clustering
,
we
characterized
the
host
response
system
to
the
different
MERS
-
CoVs
,
with
LoCoV
inducing
early
kinetic
changes
,
between
3
and
12
hours
post
infection
,
compared
to
EMC
.

Robust
transcriptional
changes
distinguished
the
two
MERS
-
CoV
strains
predominantly
at
the
late
time
points
.

Combining
statistical
analysis
of
infection
and
cytokine
-
stimulated
treatment
transcriptomics
,
we
identified
differential
innate
and
pro
-
inflammatory
responses
between
the
two
virus
strains
,
including
up
-
regulation
of
extracellular
remodeling
genes
following
LoCoV
infection
and
differential
pro
-
inflammatory
responses
between
the
two
strains
.

  

Conclusions
:
These
transcriptional
differences
may
be
the
result
of
amino
acid
differences
in
viral
proteins
known
to
modulate
innate
immunity
against
MERS
infection
.

Triplicate

The
objective
of
this
study
is
to
identify
a
prognostic
signature
in
colorectal
cancer
(
CRC
)
patients
with
diverse
progression
and
heterogeneity
of
CRCs
.

We
generated
RNA

seq
data
of
54
samples
(
normal
colon
,
primary
CRC
,
and
liver

)
from
18
CRC
patients
and
,
from
the
RNA

seq
data
,
identified
significant
genes
associated
with
aggressiveness
of
CRC
.

Through
diverse
statistical
methods
including
generalized
linear
model
likelihood
ratio
test
,
two
significantly
activated
regulators
were
identified
.

In
the
validation
cohorts
,
two
activated
regulators
were
independent
risk
factors
and
potential
chemotherapy
-
sensitive
agenets
in
colorectal
cancers
.

RNA

seq
data
of
54
samples
(
normal

)
were
generated
from
18
CRC
patients
.

Total

was
isolated
by
RNeasy
Mini

(
Qiagen
,
CA
,
USA
)
,
according
to
the
manufacturer
's
protocol
.

The
quality
and
integrity
of
the
RNA
were
confirmed
by
agarose
gel
electrophoresis
and
ethidium

staining
,
followed
by
visual
examination
under
ultraviolet

.

Sequencing
library
was
prepared
using
TruSeq
RNA
Sample
Preparation
kit
v2
(
Illumina
,
CA
,

)
according
to
the
manufacturer–•s
protocols
.

Briefly
,
mRNA
was
purified
from
total
RNA
using
poly

T
oligo
-
attached
magnetic

,
fragmented
,
and
converted
into
cDNAs
.

Then
,
adapters
were
ligated
and
the
fragments
were
amplified
on
a
PCR
.

Sequencing
was
performed
in
paired
end
reads
(
2x100
bp
)
using
Hiseq-2000
(
Illumina
)
.

In
this
study
we
present
the
first

in
patients
with

of
this
approach
in

was
used
to
asses

.

It
is
gradually
becoming
a
new
aspect
in
research
to
search
and
explore
embryo
development
for
malignant

hidden
in
tumor
cells
.

In
this
study
,
the
gene
expression
profiles
for
human
lungs
at
four
developmental
stages
and
lung
adenocarcinoma
(
ADC
)
were
depicted
,
respectively
.

The
molecular
dynamics
was
compared
for
development
and
lung
ADC
,
and
it
was
proposed
that
primary
lung
ADC
may
hijack
part
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
lung
development
to
down
-
regulate
homeostasis
-
associated
genes
and
up
-
regulate
stemness
-
associated
genes
;
and
it
was
revealed
that
the
genes
with
monotonely
decreasing
expression
trend
during
lung
development
process
are
enriched
with
lung
ADC
prognostic
information
.

The
study
material
for
developing
lung
consisted
of
29
cases
of
therapeutic

.

The
samples
included
whole

and
lungs
at
16
to
24
PWs
(

were
carefully
obtained
from
medical

with
the
guidance
of
a
Nikon
stereo

collected
when
autopsies
were
performed
.

Embryo

This
study
sought
to
identify
T1D

in
the
peripheral

(

.

Peripheral

were
purified
by

SOX2
is
an
oncogene
and
a
core
pluripotency
transcription
factor
.

SOX2
has
multiple
roles
in
various
malignancies
,
in
the
maintainance
of
pluripotency
and
during
various
stages
of
embryonic
development
.

Human
embryonal
carcinoma
cells
express
SOX2
and
the
loss
of
this
results
in
their
differentiation
.

We
silenced
SOX2
in
two
human
embryonal
carcinoma
cell
lines
and
measured
whole
-
genome
mRNA
expression
.

Many
genes
related
to
embryogenesis
and
tissue
morphogensis
were
upregulated
.

Other
upregulated
genes
were
markers
of
mesodermal
development
and
epithelial
-
to
-
mesenchymal
transition
.

A
specific
and
validated
siRNA
against
SOX2
was
chemically
transfected
in
undifferentiated
2102Ep
and
NTera-2
embryonal
carcinoma
cell
lines
.

After
three
days
of
incubation
under
normal
growth
conditions
we
used
Affymetrix
microarrays
to
measure
whole

in
three
biological
replicates
of

and
compared
this
to
whole

Our
studies
indicate
that
glucose
and
acetate
can
regulate
histone
acetylation
by
altering
the
acetyl
-
CoA
concentrations
in
the
cell
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
to
determine
whether
specific
gene
sets
correlated
with
acetyl
-
CoA
availability
.

We
conclude
that
10
%
of
glucose
-
regulated
genes
are
acetyl
-
CoA
regulated
genes
(
genes
suppressed
or
induced
by
low
glucose
and
reversed
by
acetate
)
.

Acetate
usually
regulated
gene
expression
in
the
same
direction
as
glucose
,
suggesting
that
acetyl
-
CoA
is
a
key
mediator
of
glucose
-
dependent
gene
expression
.

Recent
reports
of
directed
reprogramming
have
raised
questions
about
the
stability
of
cell
lineages
.

 
Here
,
we
have
addressed
this
issue
,
focusing
upon
skin
-
derived
precursors
(
SKPs
)
,
a
dermally
-
derived
precursor
cell
.

 
We
show
by
lineage
tracing
that
murine
SKPs
from
dorsal
skin
originate
from
mesenchymal
and
not
neural
crest
-
derived
cells
.

 
These
mesenchymally
-
derived
SKPs
can
,
without
genetic
manipulation
,
generate
functional
Schwann
cells
,
a
neural
crest
cell
type
,
and
are
highly
similar
at
the
transcriptional
level
to
Schwann
cells
isolated
from
the
peripheral
nerve
.

 
This
is
not
a
mouse
-
specific
phenomenon
,
since
human
SKPs
that
are
highly
similar
at
the
transcriptome
level
can
be
made
from
facial
(
neural
crest
-
derived
)
and
foreskin
(
mesodermally
-
derived
)
dermis
,
and
the
mesodermally
-
derived
SKPs
can
make
myelinating
Schwann
cells
.

 
Thus
,
non
-
neural
crest
-
derived
mesenchymal
precursors
can
differentiate
into
bona
fide
peripheral
glia
in
the
absence
of
genetic
manipulation
,
suggesting
that
developmentally
-
defined
lineage
boundaries
are
more
flexible
than
widely
thought
.

We
obtained
4
independent
samples
of
neonatal
human
foreskin
and
4
independent
samples
of
discarded
facial
skin
tissue
from
children
less
than
two
years
old
.

 
Primary
cells
were
isolated
and
cultured
as
SKPs
and
RNA
was
collected
from
those
cultured
samples
.

 
RNA
samples
deriving
from
these
cells
were
analyzed
on
the
Affymetrix

Urothelial
cell
carcinoma
of
the
bladder
(
UCC
)
is
a
common
disease
characterized
by
FGFR3
mutation
.

Whilst
upregulation
of
this
oncogene
occurs
most
frequently
in
low
-
grade
non
-
invasive
tumors
,
recent
data
reveal
increased
FGFR3
expression
characterizes
a
common
sub
-
type
of
invasive
UCC
sharing
genetic
similarities
with
lobular
breast
cancer
.

These
similarities
include
upregulation
of
the
FOXA1
transcription
factor
and
reduced
expression
of
microRNAs-99a/100
.

We
have
previously
identified
direct
regulation
of
FGFR3
by
these
two
microRNAs
and
now
search
for
further
targets
.

Using
a
microarray
meta
-
database
we
find
potential
FOXA1
regulation
by
microRNAs-99a/100
.

We
confirm
direct
targeting
of
the
FOXA1
3–•UTR
by
microRNAs-99a/100
and
also
potential
indirect
regulation
through
microRNA-485
-
5p
/
SOX5
/
JUN
-
D
/
FOXL1
and
microRNA-486
/
FOXO1a
.

In
292
benign
and
malignant
urothelial
samples
,
we
find
an
inverse
correlation
between
the
expression
of
FOXA1
and
microRNAs-99a/100
(
r=-0.33
to
-0.43
,
p<0.05
)
.

As
for
FGFR3
in
UCC
,
tumors
with
high
FOXA1
expression
have
lower
rates
of
progression
than
those
with
low
expression
(
Log
rank
p=0.009
)
.

Using
global
gene
expression
and
CpG
methylation
profiling
we
find
genotypic
consequences
of
FOXA1
upregulation
in
UCC
.

These
are
associated
with
regional
hypomethylation
and
near
FOXA1
binding
sites
,
and
mirror
patterns
previously
reported
in
FGFR3
mutant
UCC
.

These
include
gene
silencing
through
aberrant
hypermethylation
(
e.g.
IGFBP3
)
and
affect
genes
that
characterize
lobular
breast
cancer
(
e.g.
ERBB2
,
XBP1
)
.

In
conclusion
,
we
have
identified
microRNAs-99a/100
mediate
a
direct
relationship
between
FGFR3
and
FOXA1
,
and
potentially
facilitate
cross
talk
between
these
pathways
in
UCC
.

Accordingly
,
inhibition
of
eIF4A
with
Silvestrol
has
powerful
therapeutic
effects
in

in

.

We
use
transcriptome

scale
ribosome
footprinting
to
identify
the
hallmarks
of
eIF4A
-
dependent
transcripts
.

These
include
5'UTR
sequences
such
as
the
12
-
mer
guanine
quartet
(
CGG)4
motif
that
can
form
RNA
G
-
quadruplex
structures
.

Notably
,
among
the
most
eIF4A
-
dependent
and
Silvestrol
-
sensitive
transcripts
are
a
number
of
oncogenes
,
super
-
enhancer
associated
transcription
factors
,
and
epigenetic
regulators
.

Hence
,
the
5'UTRs
of
selected
cancer
genes
harbour
a
targetable
requirement
for
the
eIF4A
RNA
helicase
.

As

,
SM5

can
target
a
membrane
protein
of
about
230kDa
over

expressed
in
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
,
melanoma
and
breast
cancer
and
it
has
been
found
to
inhibit
the
progress
of
tumor
cells
.

In
this
study
,
SM5

conjugated
gold
nanoparticles
were
prepared
to
study
the
antitumor
efficacy
in
the
treatment
of
HCC
-

-

tumor
.

The
results
showed
that
AU

SM5

could
inhibit
HCC

cell
proliferation
up
to
71.26
%
at
the
concentration
of
0.5mg

.

In
order
to
address
the
mechanism
of
the
antiproliferative
effects
of
AU
-
SM5
-
1
,
we
examined
the
gene
expression
in
HCC
-
LM3
-
fLuc
 
tumor
cells
based
on
gene
-
chip
screening
.

The
gene

results
showed
that
some
cycle
-
related
and
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
related
genes
including
up
-
regulated
P21
and
down
-

which
were

Epidemiological
studies
provide
strong
evidence
that
consumption
of
cruciferous
vegetables
,
such
as
broccoli
,
can
significantly
reduce
the
risk
of
developing
cancers
.

Sulforaphane
(
SFN
)
,
a
phytochemical
derived
from
cruciferous
vegetables
,
induces
anti
-
proliferative
and
pro
-
apoptotic
responses
in
prostate
cancer
cells
,
but
not
in
normal
prostate
cells
.

The
mechanisms
responsible
for
these
specific
chemopreventive
properties
remain
unclear
.

We
utilized
RNA
sequencing
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
SFN
modifies
the
expression
of
genes
that
are
critical
in
prostate
cancer
progression
.

Normal
prostate
epithelial
cells
,
and
androgen
-
dependent
and
androgen
-
independent
prostate
cancer
cells
were
treated
with
15
¬µM
SFN
and
the
transcriptome
was
determined
at
6
and
24
hour
time
points
.

SFN
altered
the
expression
of
~3,000
genes
in
each
cell
line
and
the
response
was
highly
dynamic
over
time
.

SFN
influenced
the
expression
of
genes
in
functional
groups
and
pathways
that
are
critical
in
cancer
including
cell
cycle
,
apoptosis
and
angiogenesis
,
but
the
specific
effects
of
SFN
differed
depending
on
the
state
of
cancer
progression
.

Network
analysis
suggested
that
a
transcription
factor
that
is
overexpressed
in
many
cancers
,
Specificity
protein
1
(
Sp1
)
,
is
a
major
mediator
of
SFN
-
induced
changes
in
gene
expression
.

Nuclear
Sp1
protein
was
significantly
decreased
by
24
hour
SFN
treatment
in
prostate
cancer
cells
,
while
a
related
transcription
factor
,
Sp3
protein
was
only
modestly
decreased
in
androgen
-
independent
prostate
cancer
cells
.

 
Overall
,
the
data
show
that
SFN
significantly
affects
gene
expression
in
normal
and
cancer
cells
,
with
key
targets
in
chemopreventive
processes
,
making
it
a
promising
dietary
anti
-
cancer
agent
.

using
a

.

 
In
order
to
understand
the
mechanisms
by
which
these
genes
contributed
to
vorinostat
response
,
transcriptomic
analysis
was
conducted
on
HCT116
-
VR
cells
and
those
with
siRNA
-
mediated
knockdown
of
each
of
the
vorinostat

candidate
genes
.

There
are
45
samples
in

,
from

biological
experiments
of
15
samples
each
.

Facioscapulohumeral
dystrophy
(
FSHD
)
is
caused
by
decreased
epigenetic
repression
of
the
D4Z4
macrosatellite
array
and
recent
studies
have
shown
that
this
results
in
the
expression
of
low
levels
of
the
DUX4
mRNA
in
skeletal
muscle
.

Several
other
mechanisms
have
been
suggested
for
FSHD
pathophysiology
and
it
remains
unknown
whether
DUX4
expression
can
account
for
most
of
the
molecular
changes
seen
in
FSHD
.

Since
DUX4
is
a
transcription
factor
,
we
used
RNA
-
seq
to
measure
gene
expression
in
muscle
cells
transduced
with
DUX4
,
and
in
muscle
cells
and
biopsies
from
control
and
FSHD
individuals
.

We
show
that
DUX4
target
gene
expression
is
the
major
molecular
signature
in
FSHD
muscle
together
with
a
gene
expression
signature
consistent
with
an
immune
cell
infiltration
.

In
addition
,
one
unaffected
individual
without
a
known
FSHD
-
causing
mutation
showed
expression
of
DUX4
target
genes
.

This
individual
has
a
sibling
with
FSHD
and
also
without
a
known
FSHD
-
causing
mutation
,
suggesting
the
presence
of
yet
unidentified
modifier
locus
for
DUX4
expression
and
FSHD
.

These
findings
demonstrate
that
expression
of
DUX4
accounts
for
the
majority
of
the
gene
expression
changes
in
FSHD
skeletal
muscle
together
with
an
immune
cell
infiltration
.

Lung
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(
SCC
)
is
thought
to
arise
from
premalignant
lesions
in
the
airway

,
therefore
studying
these
lesions
is
critical
for
understanding
lung

We

We
discovered
transcriptomic

We
used

psychiatric
disorders
affect
the
cerebral
cortex
,
and
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
molecular
processes
underlying
human
corticogenesis
will
provide
greater
insight
into
such
pathologies
.

To
date
,
knowledge
of
gene
expression
changes
accompanying
corticogenesis
is
largely
based
on
murine
data
.

Here
we
present
a
searchable
,
comprehensive
,
temporal
gene
expression
dataset
encompassing
cerebral
cortical
development
from
human
embryonic
stem
cells
(
hESCs
)
.

Using
a
modified
differentiation
protocol
and
RNA
-
Seq
technology
with
computational
analysis
,
we
identified
sets
of
genes
and
long
non
-
coding
RNAs
that
significantly
change
during
corticogenesis
,
and
those
enriched
for
disease
-
associations
.

Numerous
alternatively
-
spliced
genes
with
varying
temporal
patterns
of
expression
are
revealed
,
including
TGIF1
,
involved
in
holoprosencephaly
and
MARK1
,
involved
in
autism
.

We
have
created
a
database
(
<
a

target="_blank">http://cortecon.neuralsci.org</a
>
)
that
provides
online

access
to
changes
in
RNA

and
alternatively

transcripts
during
human

Familial
platelet
disorder
with
predisposition
to
acute
myeloid
leukemia
(
FPD
/
AML
)
is
an
autosomal
dominant
disease
of
the
hematopoietic
system
,
which
is
caused
by
heterozygous
mutations
in
RUNX1
.

 
FPD
/
AML
patients
have
a
bleeding
disorder
characterized
by
thrombocytopenia
with
reduced
platelet
numbers
and
functions
,
and
a
tendency
to
develop
AML
.

Currently
no
suitable
animal
models
exist
for
FPD
/
AML
as
Runx1+/-
mice
and
zebrafish
do
not
develop
bleeding
disorders
or
leukemia
.

Here
we
derived
induced
pluripotent
stem
cells
(
iPSCs
)
from
two
patients
in
a
family
with
FPD
/
AML
,
and
found
that
the
FPD
iPSCs
display
defects
in
megakaryocytic
differentiation
in
vitro
.

 
We
corrected
the
RUNX1
mutation
in
one
FPD
iPSC
line
through
gene
targeting
,
which
led
to
normalization
of
megakaryopoiesis
of
the
iPSCs
in
culture
.

 
Our
results
demonstrate
successful
in
vitro
modeling
of
FPD
with
patient
-
specific
iPSCs
and
confirm
that
RUNX1
mutations
are
responsible
for
megakaryopoietic
defects
in
FPD
patients
.

Here
,
we
derived
iPSCs
from
two
FPD
/
AML
patients
and
demonstrated
that
these
iPSCs
have
a
megakaryopoietic
defect
in
culture
.

 
Importantly
we
were
able
to
rescue
the
megakaryopoietic
defect
by
correcting
the
RUNX1
mutation
with
a
gene
targeting
strategy
enhanced
by
zinc
finger
nucleases
(
ZFNs
)
.

 
Three
independent
samples
were
obtained
for
each
time
point
.

The
goal
of
this
project
is
to
study
transcriptome
change
by
knocking
down
ZNF804A
,
a
schizophrenia
and
bipolar
disorder
candidate
gene
,
in
early
neurons
derived
from
iPSCs
.

Neural
progenitor
cells
(
NPCs
)
were
developed
from
human
induced
pluripotent
stem
cells
(
iPSCs
)
and
transduced
by
two
independent
shRNA
vectors
targeting
ZNF804A
,
a
schizophrenia
and
bipolar
disorder
candidate
gene
.

After
recovery
and
selection
in
puromycin
,
neuronal
differentiation
was
induced
.

After
14
days
,
RNA
was
recovered
and
analyzed
by
RNA
-
seq
.

The
expression
profiles
were
compared
with
NPCs
that
were
transduced
with
scrambled
control
vectors
.

This
corresponds
to
controls
1
-
3
and
KD
1
-
3
,
which
was
carried
out
on
a
male
iPSC
line
.

Scramble
1
and
2
and
KD1
and
2
are
technical
replicates
.

Scrambled
3
and
KD
3
were
carried
out
on
an
independent
NPC
culture
.

For
control
4
and
KD4
,
neuronal
differentiation
was
induced
,
and
on
day
10
the
cells
were
transduced
with
the
same
ZNF804A
KD
and
scrambled
control
vectors
used
for
scrambled
control
3
and
KD3
.

In
addition
,
this
last
set
was
carried
out
on
a

iPSC
line

The
polycomb
repressive
complex
2
(
PRC2
)
plays
an
oncogenic
role
in
several
cancers
.

 
However
,
loss
-
of
-
function
mutations
in
PRC2
components
have
been
detected
in
a
subset
of
hematopoietic
malignancies
,
suggesting
that
different
epigenetic
landscapes
are
required
in
different
tumor
types
.

In
this
study
we
provide
genomic
,
cellular
,
and
mouse
modeling
data
to
demonstrate
that
loss
-
of
-
function
mutations
in
the
polycomb
gene
,
SUZ12
,
and
NF1
cooperate
in
peripheral
nervous
system
tumors
,
glioblastomas
,
and
melanomas
.

NF1
encodes
a
Ras
GTPase
-
activating
protein
and
its
loss
triggers
moderate
levels
of
Ras
activation
.

 
We
show
that
SUZ12
-
loss
enhances
the
effects
of
NF1
mutations
,
in
part
,
by
amplifying
Ras
transcriptional
signatures
.

Moreover
,
SUZ12
-
loss
triggers
an
epigenetic
switch
that
confers
sensitivity
to
combined
bromodomain
and
MEK
inhibitors
in
vivo
.

Collectively
these
studies
demonstrate
an
unexpected
role
for
polycomb
group
genes
in
NF1
mutant
tumors
and
reveal
an
epigenetic
-
based
therapeutic
strategy
that
may
be
exploited
for
a
variety
of
cancers
.

RKIP
regulates
human

tumor
metastasis
.

We
use
gene
expression
array
analysis
to
identify
genes
regulated
by
RKIP
in
human
breast
cancer
cells
.

Total
RNAs
were
extracted
from
1833
cells
expressing
mutant
RKIP
(
S153E

RKIP
,
a
more
potent
Raf-1

)
and

.

Affymetrix
GeneChip

Arrays
were
performed
to
detail
the
gene
expression
and
identify
the
genes
regulated
by
RKIP
in
human
breast
cancer
cells
.

Estrogens
are
an
important
regulator
of
breast
cancer
disease
progression
,
and
they
function
by
binding
the
estrogen
receptor
--
alpha
(
ER
-
alpha
)
to
regulate
changes
in
gene
expression
.

ER
-
alpha
is
able
to
both
activate
and
inhibit
gene
transcription
in
a
gene
-
specific
manner
and
do
so
by
binding
target
DNA
sequences
and
recruiting
coactivators
and
corepressors
which
can
modulate
the
chromatin
environment
.

Silencing
mediator
of
retinoic
acid
and
thyroid
hormone
receptor
(
SMRT
)
is
known
to
act
as
coactivator
and
corepressor
of
ER
-
alpha
in
a
gene
-
specific
manner
.

We
used
a
microarray
analysis
to
examine
the
gene
expression
changes
that
occur
when
the
coregulator
SMRT
is
depleted
from
the
ER
-
alpha
positive
MCF-7
breast
cancer
cell
line
.

We
sought
to
determine
the
genes
that
are
regulated
by
depletion
of
the
coregulator
SMRT
using
Affymetrix
Human
Gene

ST
Array
.

To
this
end
,
we
transfected
MCF-7
cells
with

48
h
and

Background
:
The
Aryl
hydrocarbon
receptor
(
AHR
)
is
a
ligand
-
activated
transcription
factor
that
is
activated
by
xenobiotic
chemicals
that
function
as
AHR
ligands
.

 
The
response
to
xenobiotic
AHR
ligands
is
toxicity
and
the
induction
of
drug
metabolizing
enzymes
.

The
impact
of
AHR
knockdown
on
gene
expression
and
pathways
in
human
breast
cancer
cells
in
absence
of
xenobiotic
AHR
ligands
has
not
been
investigated
on
a
genome
-
wide
scale
.

Methods
:
MCF-7
cells
were
used
as
a
model
of
human
breast
cancer
.

 
The
AHR
was
silenced
with
short
interfering
RNA
against
AHR
(
siAHR
)
.

 
RNA
-
sequencing
coupled
with
Ingenuity
pathway
analysis
(
IPA
)
was
used
to
determine
the
impact
of
AHR
knockdown
on
gene
expression
and
pathways
in
the
absence
of
xenobiotic
AHR
ligands
.

 
Western
blot
analysis
and
recombinant
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF
)
was
used
to
investigate
the
impact
of
AHR
knockdown
on
TNF
induction
of
MNSOD
expression
.

Results
:
We
found
that
the
AHR
is
transcriptionally
active
in
MCF-7
breast
cancer
cells
in
the
absence
of
xenobiotic
AHR
ligands
.

 
In
total
,
the
expression
of
634
genes
was
significantly
changed
in
AHR
knockdown
cells
compared
to
controls
at
a
false
discovery
rate
of
<
10
%
.

The
analysis
confirmed
that
drug
metabolizing
enzymes
were
AHR
targets
;
however
,
we
found
that
AHR
also
promoted
the
expression
of
genes
that
were
not
directly
related
to
the
metabolism
of
xenobiotics
,
such
as
those
involved
in
lipid
and
eicosanoid
synthesis
.

 
Gene
pathway
analysis
of
the
AHR
regulated
gene
dataset
predicted
TNF
activity
to
be
reduced
in
AHR
knockdown
cells
.

 
Our
finding
that
AHR
knockdown
inhibited
TNF
-
stimulated
increases
in
MNSOD
expression
confirmed
this
IPA
prediction
.

Conclusions
:
This
is
the
first
gene
expression
profiling
study
of
AHR
knockdown
breast
cancer
cells
.

 
Several
known
and
novel
AHR
targets
were
identified
.

 
The
results
suggest
that
endogenous
AHR
regulation
impacts
eicosanoid
synthesis
by
regulating
gene
expression
.

 
The
IPA
prediction
of
reduced
TNF
activity
in
AHR
knockdown
cells
was
confirmed
by
showing
that
TNF
-
induced
increases
in
MNSOD
expression
was
inhibited
in
AHR
knockdown
cells
.

  

The
requirement
of
AHR
for
MNSOD
activation
is
novel
and
provides
a
new
link
by
which
AHR
may
impact
reactive
oxidative
species
(
ROS
)
signaling
.

Expression
profiles
by
mRNA
sequencing
were
generated
for
human
MCF-7
cells
transfected
with
cRNAi
(
6
replicates
)
or
AHR
-
siRNA
(
5
replicates
)
for
36hr
.

Sequencing
was
performed
on
an
Illumina
HiSeq
1000
using
a
2x100
base
paired

strategy
.

After
2
and
12
weeks
of
treatment
,
we
observed
significant
reductions
of
51
%
and
72
%
,
respectively
,
in
SCORAD
scores
.

Clinical
improvements
were
associated
with
significant
gene
expression
changes
in
lesional
but
also
nonlesional
skin
,
particularly
reductions
in
levels
of
TH2-
,
TH22-

Background
:
The
ZNF217
gene
,
encoding
a
C2H2
zinc
finger
protein
,
is
located
at
20q13
and
found
amplified
and
overexpressed
in
greater
than
20
%
of
breast
tumors
.

Current
studies
indicate
ZNF217
drives
tumorigenesis
,
yet
the
regulatory
mechanisms
of
ZNF217
are
largely
unknown
.

Because
ZNF217
associates
with
chromatin
modifying
enzymes
,
we
postulate
that
ZNF217
functions
to
regulate
specific
gene
signaling
networks
.

Here
,
we
present
a
large
-
scale
functional
genomic
analysis
of
ZNF217
,
which
provides
insights
into
the
regulatory
role
of
ZNF217
in
MCF7
breast
cancer
cells
.

Results
:
ChIP
-
seq
analysis
reveals
that
the
majority
of
ZNF217
binding
sites
are
located
at
distal
regulatory
regions
associated
with
the
chromatin
marks
H3K27ac
and
H3K4me1
.

Analysis
of
ChIPseq
transcription
factor
binding
sites
shows
clustering
of
ZNF217
with
FOXA1
,
GATA3
and
ERalpha
binding
sites
,
supported
by
the
enrichment
of
corresponding
motifs
for
the
ERalpha
-
associated
cisregulatory
sequences
.

ERalpha
expression
highly
correlates
with
ZNF217
in
lysates
from
breast
tumors
(
n=15
)
,
and
ERalpha
co
-
precipitates
ZNF217
and
its
binding
partner
CtBP2
from
nuclear
extracts
.

Transcriptome
profiling
following
ZNF217
depletion
identifies
differentially
expressed
genes
co
-
bound
by
ZNF217
and
ERalpha
;
gene
ontology
suggests
a
role
for
ZNF217
-
ERalpha
in
expression
programs
associated
with
ER+
breast
cancer
studies
found
in
the
Molecular

Database
.

Data
-
mining
of
expression
data
from
breast
cancer
patients
correlates
ZNF217
with
reduced
overall
survival
in
multiple
subtypes
.

Conclusions
:
Our
genome
-
wide
ZNF217
data
suggests
a
functional
role
for
ZNF217
at
ERalpha
target
genes
.

Future
studies
will
investigate
whether
ZNF217
expression
contributes
to
aberrant
ERalpha
regulatory
events
in

To
unravel

We
knocked
down

.

By
comparing
the

,
we
are
able
to
dissect
the
cellular
pathways
affected
by
alteration

array
We
used
microarrays
to
dissect
the
possible
changes
occurring
at
mRNA
level
in
mutated
cells
versus
the
parental
cellular
counterpart
.

Salmonella
enterica
is
a
Gram
-
negative
bacterium
that
causes
gastroenteritis
,
bacteremia
and
typhoid
fever
in
several
animal
species
including
humans
.

Its
virulence
is
greatly
dependent
on
two
type
III
secretion
systems
(
T3SSs
)
,
encoded
in
pathogenicity
islands
1
(
SPI1
)
and
2
(
SPI2
)
,
respectively
.

These
systems
translocate
proteins
called
effectors
into
eukaryotic
host
cell
.

Effectors
interfere
with
certain
host
signal
transduction
pathways
to
allow
the
internalization
of
pathogens
and
their
survival
and
proliferation
inside
vacuoles
.

SteA
is
one
of
the
few
Salmonella
effectors
that
are
substrates
of
both
T3SSs
.

Nothing
is
known
about
the
function
of
this
protein
inside
the
host
cells
.

Here
,
we
used
gene
arrays
and
bioinformatics
analysis
to
study
the
genetic
response
of
human
epithelial
cells
to
SteA.
 
We
found
that
constitutive
synthesis
of
SteA
in
epithelial
cells
leads
to
induction
of
genes
related
to
extracellular
matrix
organization
and
regulation
of
cell
proliferation
and
serine
/
threonine
kinase
signaling
pathways
.

SteA
also
represses
genes
related
to
immune
processes
and
regulation
of
purine
nucleotide
synthesis
and
pathway
-
restricted
SMAD
protein
phosphorylation
.

Consisted
with
this
analysis
a
cell
biology
approach
revealed
that
epithelial
cells
expressing
steA
show
altered
cell
morphology
,
reduction
of
cytotoxicity
,
cell
-
cell
adhesion
and
migration
capability
,
and
increase
in
endocytosis
.

replicated
three
times
.

Both
diploid
RPE-1
and
BJ-1
cells
were
made
tetraploid
by
transient

with
the
cytokinesis
inhibitor
DCD
.

Proliferating
tetraploids
from
both
BJ-1
and
RPE-1
were
selected
and
isolated
.

The
gene
expression
profiles
of
the
proliferating
tetraploid
cells
were
then
compared
to
the
diploids
from
which
they
originated
.

Triplicate
biological
samples
were
collected
and
analyed
.

Vemurafenib
is
a
BRAF
inhibitor
with
specificity
for
the
most
common
BRAF
mutant
encountered
in
melanomas
(
BRAFV600E
)
.

Vemurafenib
suppresses
the
proliferation
of
BRAF
mutant
human
melanoma
cells
by
suppressing
downstream
activation
of
the
MEK
/
ERK
mitogen
activated
protein
kinases
.

We
used
microarrays
to
examine
the
transcriptional

of
a

(

)
to
vemurafenib
in
order
to
further
delineate
the
mechanisms
by
which
BRAFV600E
drives
cell
proliferation
and
energy
metabolism
in

Rationale
:
Genome
-
wide
association
studies
(
GWAS
)
and
candidate
gene
studies
have
identified
a
number
of
loci
linked
to
susceptibility
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
,
a
smoking
-
related
disorder
that
originates
in
the
airway
epithelium
.

Objectives
:
Since
airway
basal
cell
(
BC
)
stem
/
progenitor
cells
exhibit
the
earliest
abnormalities
associated
with
smoking
(
hyperplasia
,
squamous
metaplasia
)
,
we
hypothesized
that
smoker
BC
have
a
dysregulated
transcriptome
linked
,
in
part
,
to
known
GWAS
/
candidate
gene
loci
.

Methods
:
Massive
parallel
RNA
sequencing
was
used
to
compare
the
transcriptome
of
BC
purified
from
the
airway
epithelium
of
healthy
nonsmokers
(
n=10
)
and
smokers
(
n=7
)
.

The
chromosomal
location
of
the
differentially
expressed
genes
was
compared
to
loci
identified
by
GWAS
and
candidate
gene
studies
to
confer
risk
for
COPD
.

Measurements
and
Main
Results
:
Smoker
BC
have
676
known
genes
differentially
expressed
compared
to
nonsmoker
BC
,
dominated
by
smoking
up
-
regulation
.

Strikingly
,
166
(
25
%
)
of
these
genes
are
located
on
chromosome
19
,
with
13
localized
to
19q13.2
(
p<10
-
4
compared
to
chance
)
,
including
TGFB1
,
LTBP4
,
EGLN2
and
NFKBIB
,
genes
associated
with
risk
for
COPD
.

Conclusions
:
These
observations
provide
the
first
direct
link
of
known
genetic
risks
for
smoking
-
related
lung
disease
with
the
specific
population
of
lung
cells
that
undergoes
the
earliest
changes
associated
with
smoking
.

The
human
airway

transcriptome
of

smokers
versus
10
nonsmokers
was
compared
using
massive

(
Illumina
HiSeq

)
.

The
cytotoxic
drug
edelfosine
is
a
synthetic
analog
of
2
-
lysophosphatidylcholine
.

Edelfosine
is
incorporated
by
highly
proliferating
cells
,
e.g.
activated
immune
cells
.

It
is
unknown
if
the
described
mechanisms
for
edelfosine
action
attained
by
in
vitro
approaches
exclusively
contribute
to
the
observed
EAE
-
amelioration
or
if
edelfosine
may
exert
additional
,
probably
more
general
and
possibly
immunoablative
effects
within
the
setting
of
autoimmunity
.

We
used
microarray
analysis
in
order
to
confirm
proposed
mechanisms
of
edelfosine
action
,
but
also
to
discover
novel
effects
of
edelfosine
in
the
context
of

In

we

revealed

(
for

)
.

RT

studies
show
SENCR
exists
in
two
isoforms
and
is
transcribed
antisense
from
the
5–•
end
of
the
FLI1
gene
.

Knockdown
of
SENCR
has
no
effect
on
FLI1
mRNA
or
protein
expression
.

Biochemical
fractionation
and
RNA
fluorescence
in

(

)
studies
indicate
SENCR
is
a
cytoplasmic
lncRNA
.

disclose
decreased

of

.

Total
RNAs
of
3
replicates
of
normal

(
Mock1

)
were
sequenced
and
analyzed
for
identification
of
novel

.

One
of
identified
novel
lncRNAs
from
that
experiment
is
SENCR
.

To
study
its
function
,
SENCR
knock

experiment
were
performed
and
then
RNA
-
seq
profiles
of
3
replicates
of
both
SENCR

samples
and
corresponding
controls
were
compared
.

Gene
expression
profiles
of
Molt4
cells
treated
with
DMCS
(
vehicle
)
or
farnesol
were
compared
to
understand
the
mechanism
by
which
farnesol
induces
apoptosis
in
these
cells
.

Molt4
cells
were
treated
with
75
uM
farnesol
for
4
hrs
to
compare
with

Molt4

.

from
three

was
then

Significant
qualitative
and
quantitative
differences
exist
between
humans
and
the
animal
models
used
in
research
.

However
,
significant
quantitative
and
qualitative
differences
exist
between
humans
and
the
animal
models
used
in
research
.

This
is
as
a
result
of
genetic
variation
between
human
and
the
laboratory
animal
.

Therefore
the
development
of
a
system
that
would
allow
the
assessment
of
all
molecular
differences
between
species
after
drug
exposure
would
have
a
significant
impact
on
drug
evaluation
for
toxicity
and
efficacy
.

Here
we
describe
a
cross
-
species
microarray
methodology
that
identifies
and
selects
orthologous
probes
after
cross
-
species
sequence
comparison
to
develop
an
orthologous
cross
-
species
gene
expression
analysis
tool
.

The
assumptions
made
by
the
use
of
this
orthologous
gene
expression
strategy
for
cross
-
species
extrapolation
is
that
;
conserved
changes
in
gene
expression
equate
to
conserved
pharmacodynamic
endpoints
.

This
assumption
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
evolution
and
selection
have
maintained
the
structure
and
function
of
many
biochemical
pathways
over
time
,
resulting
in
the
conservation
of
many
important
processes
.

We
demonstrate
this
difference
using
a
cross
-
species
methodology
by
investigating
species
specific
differences
of
the
peroxisome
proliferator
activator
receptor
(
PPAR
)
alpha
in
rat
and
human
.

Human
primary
hepatocytes
were
treated
with
30
uM
,
100
uM
EMD
and
0.1
%
DMSO
as
vehicle
control
.

All
samples
were
incubated
at
24hr
and
72hr
intervals
before
RNA
extractions
and
hybridization
onto
Affymetrix
human
microarrays
.

WNT
-
induced
secreted
protein
1
(
WISP1
/
CCN4
)
,
a
member
of
the
CCN
protein
family
,
acts
as
a
downstream
factor
of
the
canonical
WNT
-
signaling
pathway
.

A
dysregulated
expression
of
WISP1
often
reflects
its
oncogenic
potential
by
inhibition
of
apoptosis
,
a
necessary
form
of
cell
death
that
protect
cell
populations
for
transformation
into
malignant
phenotypes
.

WISP1
-
signaling
is
also
known
to
affect
proliferation
and
differentiation
of
human
mesenchymal
stem
cells
(
hMSCs
)
,
which
are
fundamental
for
the
constitution
and
maintenance
of
the
musculoskeletal
system
.

Our
study
emphasizes
the
importance
of
WISP1
-
signaling
for
cell
survival
of
primary
human
cells
.

Therefore
,
we
established
a
successful
down
-
regulation
of
endogenous
WISP1
transcripts
through
gene
silencing
in
hMSCs
.

We
were
able
to
demonstrate
the
consequence
of
cell
death
immediately
after
WISP1
down
-
regulation
took
place
.

Bioinformatical
analyses
of
subsequent
performed
microarrays
from
WISP1
down
-
regulated
vs.
control
samples
confirmed
this
observation
.

We
uncovered
several
clusters
of
differential
expressed
genes
important
for
cellular
apoptosis
induction
and
immuno
-
regulatory
processes
,
thereby
indicating
TRAIL
-
induced
and
p53
-
mediated
apoptosis
as
well
as
IFNbeta
-
signaling
.

Since
all
of
them
act
as
potent
inhibitors
for
malignant
cell
growth
,
in
vitro
knowledge
about
the
connection
with
WISP1
-
signaling
could
help
to
find
new
therapeutic
approaches
concerning
cancerogenesis
and
tumor
growth
in
musculoskeletal
tissues
.

We
established
a
successful
down

regulation
of
endogenous
WISP1

through

in

The
development
of
affinity
purification
technologies
together
with
mass
spectrometric
analyses
of
the
purified
protein
mixtures
(
AP
-
MS
)
has
been
used
both
to
identify
new
protein
-
protein
interactions
and
to
define
the
subunit
composition
of
protein
complexes
.

Transcription
factor
protein
interactions
,
however
,
have
not
been
systematically
analyzed
using
these
approaches
.

Here
,
we
have
investigated
whether
ectopic
expression
of
an
affinity
tagged
transcription
factor
as
bait
in
AP
-
MS
experiments
perturbs
gene
expression
in
cells
resulting
in
false
positive
identification
of
bait
associated
proteins
when
typical
experimental
controls
are
used
.

Using
quantitative
proteomics
and
RNA
-
Seq
,
we
determined
that
the
increase
in
the
abundance
of
a
set
of
proteins
caused
by
overexpression
of
the
transcription
factor
RelA
is
not
sufficient
for
these
proteins
to
then
copurify
non
-
specifically
and
be
misidentified
as
bait
associated
proteins
.

Therefore
typical
controls
should
be
sufficient
and
a
number
of
different
baits
can
be
compared
with
a
common
set
of
controls
.

This
is
of
practical
interest
when
identifying
bait
interactors
from
a
large
number
of
different
baits
.

As
expected
,
we
found
several
known
RelA
interactors
enriched
in
our
RelA
purifications
(
NF—íB1
,
NF—íB2
,
Rel
,
RelB
,
I—íB‚Ä°
,
I—íB‚Ä∞
and
I—íB–ä
)
.

We
also
found
several
proteins
not
previously
described
in
association
with
RelA
,
including
the
small
mitochondrial
chaperone
Tim13
.

Using
a
variety
of
biochemical
approaches
,
we
further
investigated
the
nature
of
the
association
between
Tim13
and
NF—íB
family
transcription
factors
.

The
work
here
therefore
provides
a
conceptual
and
experimental
framework
for
analyzing
transcription
faction
protein
interactions
.

Results
provide
insight
into
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
ANP
in
vascular
endothelial
cell
.

ANP
induced
gene
expression
in
HUVEC
was
measured
at
0
,
1
and
6
hours
.

 
Four
independent
experiments
were
performed
at
each
time
(
0
,
1
or
6
hours
)
for
each
experiment
.

RAD51B
,
a
paralog
of
RAD51
,
have
been
associated
with
breast
cancer
risk
in
genome
-
wide
association
studies
.

The
underlying
biological
mechanism
through
which
germline
genetic
variation
in
RAD51B
confers
susceptibility
to
breast
cancer
is
not
well
understood
.

Here
we
investigate
the
molecular
function
of
RAD51B
in
breast
cancer
cell
lines
.

We
used
microarrays
to
detail
the
global
gene
expression
to
identify
classes
of
genes
that
are
regulated
 
differnetly
post
DNA
damages
as
a
result
of
RAD51B
depeletion
.

T47D
cells
were
first
transfected
with
either
non
-
targeting
(
control
;
siCON
)
or
RAD51B
-
targeting
(
experimental
;
siRAD51B
)
siRNA
,
then
followed
by
24hr
treatment
of
2mM
hydroxyurea
(
HU
)
.

Total
RNA
were
extracted
at
the
end
of
the
treatment
for
microarray
analysis
.

Three
biological
replicates
were
carried
out
for
both
control
and
experimental
samples
.

FK506
binding
protein
51kDa
(
FKBP51
/
FKBP5
)
is
part
of
a
mature
heat
shock
protein
90kDa
(
Hsp90
)
chaperone
complex
that
preserves
tau
.

Microarray
analysis
of
human
brains
reveal
that
FKBP51
gene
expression
selectively
increased
with
age
and
Alzheimer
's
disease
,
which
correlated
with
demethylation
of
the
regulatory
regions
in
the
FKBP5
gene
.

Moreover
,
FKBP51
levels
significantly
correlated
with
Braak
pathological
staging
.

 
In
addition
,
we
show
that
in
brains
devoid
of
FKBP51
,
tau
levels
are
reduced
.

Recombinant
FKBP51
and
Hsp90
synergize
to
block
tau
clearance
through
the
proteasome
and
produce
T22
-
positive
tau
oligomers
.

Overexpression
of
FKBP51
in
a
tau
transgenic
mouse
model
revealed
that
FKBP51
preserved
tau
species
,
including
phosphorylated
and
oligomeric
tau
that
have
been
linked
to
Alzheimer
's
disease
pathogenesis
.

FKBP51
blocked
amyloid
formation
and
decreased
tangle
load
in
the
brain
.

These
alterations
in
tau
turnover
and
aggregate
structure
culminated
in
enhanced
neurotoxicity
.

We
propose
a
model
where
age
-
associated
increases
in
FKBP51
levels
can
out
-
compete
the
association
of
other
pro
-
degradation
Hsp90
co
-
chaperones
,
resulting
in
neurotoxic
tau
accumulation
.

Thus
,
strategies
aimed
at
attenuating
FKBP51
levels
or
its
interaction
with
Hsp90
could
be
therapeutically
relevant
for
Alzheimer
's
disease
and
other
tauopathies
.

These
AD
cases
were
processed
simultaneously
with
the
control
cases
(
young
and
aged
)
included
in
GSE11882

Postmortem

was
collected
from

were
available

were
generated
by

were
analyzed
with

.

Validation
of

was
performed
by

Results
show
a

,
and

Amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
and
primary
lateral
sclerosis
are
two
syndromic
variants
within
the
motor
neurone
disease
spectrum
.

Whilst
primary
lateral
sclerosis
is
associated
with
loss
of
upper
motor
neurons
and
a
more
benign
disease
course
up
to
17yrs
,
 
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
is
caused
by
loss
of
both
upper
and
lower
motor
neurons
and
has
an
average
disease
course
of
2
-
3
years
.

The
majority
of
cases
are
sporadic
,
thereby
limiting
the
availability
of
cellular
models
for
investigating
pathogenic
disease
mechanisms
.

The
aim
of
the
present
study
was
to
evaluate
fibroblasts
as
a
cellular
model
for
sporadic
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
and
primary
lateral
sclerosis
,
to
establish
whether
disease
-
related
dysregulated
biological
processes
recapitulate
those
seen
in
the
central
nervous
system
and
to
elucidate
pathways
that
distinguish
between
the
two
disease
phenotypes
.

We
used
microarray
analysis
to
determine
the
differences
in
gene
expression
between
fibroblasts
derived
from
skin
biopsies
taken
from
sporadic
amyotrophic

,
and

.

Each
time
point
was
assayed
in
triplicate
cultures
with
the
exception
of
Day
5
,
in
which
one
outlier
culture
has
been
removed
.

The
series
were
performed
to
study
the
changes
in
gene
expression
upon
diploidization
of
KBM7
cancer
(
CML
)
cell
line
.

The
line
can
exist
either
as
a
clone
with
24
chromosomes
(
nearly
haploid
)
or
with
48
chromosomes
(
nearly
diploid
)
.

Gene
expression
patterns
are
largely
ploidy
-
independent
,
as
suggested
by
this
experiment
Single
cell
derived
clones
of
KBM7

were
grown
.

Included
7
haploid
and
10
diploid
clones
,
each
with
2
independent

.

Also
included

)
samples
for

purposes
.

Activation
of
the
phosphoinositide
3
-
kinase
(
PI3K)/Akt
signaling
pathway
is
one
the
most
frequent
genetic
events
in
human
cancer
.

Therefore
,
the
development
of
PI3
K
inhibitors
has
attracted
much
attention
.

We
previously
described
the
pyrazolopyrimidine
derivative
ETP-45658
as
a
potent
inhibitor
of
PI3
K
p110–û¬±
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Here
we
report
the
gene
expression
signatures
of
MCF7
cells
treated
with
ETP-45658
or
the
reference
PI3
K
inhibitor
PI-103
.

Both
compounds
potently
inhibited
proliferation
of
a
wide
range
of
human
cancer
cells
.

ETP-45658
most
potently
suppressed
the
growth
of
PIK3CA
(
E545K)-mutated
MCF7
breast
cancer
cells
.

Treatment
with
ETP-45658
or
PI-103
resulted
in
a
time
and
concentration
-
dependent
decrease
in
phosphorylation
of
AKT
Ser473
in
MCF7
cells
.

We
conducted
microarray
analysis
examining
the
gene
expression
profile
in
MCF7
cells
at
six
hours
post
ETP-45658
or
PI-103
incubation
.

Both
compounds
induced
the
expression
of
negative
cell
cycle
regulators
including
Cyclin
G2
,
p27kip1
and
ING4
and
decreased
positive
regulators
such
as
Cyclin
D1
without
significantly
affecting
the
expression
of
pro
-
apoptotic
genes
.

We
found
FOXO
transcription
factor
binding
sites
over
-
represented
in
both
up-
and
down
-
regulated
genes
but
not
in
those
without
significant
changes
.

The
expression
of
the
breast
cancer
tumor
suppressor
Nischarin
was
found
to
be
induced
by
ETP-45658
but
not
after
PI-103
treatment
while
several
genes
differentially
expressed
specifically
after
ETP-45658
treatment
are
functionally
associated
with
the
focal
adhesion
pathway
.

Twelve
samples
have
been
analyzed
in
six
different
conditions
.

Two
replicates
have
been
included
for
each
condition
.

To
explore
the
psoriasis
phenotype
and
pathways
involved
in
psoriasis
,
we
characterized
gene
expression
in
lesional

skin
from
psoriasis
patients
.

Furthermore
,
we
explored
the
effects
of
various
doses
of
brodalumab
on
lesional
skin
over
time
.

From
each
of
the
25
psoriasis
patients
,
we
obtained
two
pre
-
dose
biopsies
,
one
from
a
lesion
and
the
other
from
non
-
lesional
skin
in
the
same
general

geography
,
and
two
post

biopsies
.

Total
RNA
was
extracted
from
6
mm
punch
biopsies
that
were
split
in
half
.

A
total
of
99
samples
were
run
on
Affymetrix

.

There
was
no

Recent
studies
suggest
that
PDEF
is
required
for
secretory
cell
differentiation
in
several
epithelial
tissues
.

To
investigate
PDEF
in
the
mammary
gland
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
this
transcription
factor
on
gene
expression
using
microarray
based
profiling
of
MCF-10A
cells
.

These
cells
are
non
-
transformed
mammary
epithelial
cells
that
express
protein
and
gene
expression
programs
of
basal
epithelial
cells
and
undetectable
levels
of
endogenous
PDEF
.

Bioinformatics
analysis
of
the
genes
induced
or
repressed
by
PDEF
overexpression
in
MCF10A
cells
revealed
a
striking
effect
on
expression
of
luminal
and
myoepithelial
cell
markers
.

Six
samples
were
harvested
26
hours
after
retroviral
infection
with
either
vector
control
or
PDEF
.

Each
condition
was
performed
in

.

It
has
been
unclear
whether

show
here
that
neither
is
the
case

Objectives
:
Idiopathic
pulmonary
fibrosis
(
IPF
)
is
a
complex
disease
in
which
a
multitude
of
proteins
and
networks
are
disrupted
.

Interrogation
of
genome
-
wide
transcription
through
RNA
sequencing
(
RNA
-
Seq
)
enables
the
determination
of
genes
whose
differential
expression
is
most
significant
in
IPF
,
as
well
as
the
detection
of
alternative
splicing
events
which
are
not
easily
observed
with
traditional
microarray
experiments
.

Methods
:
Messenger
RNA
extracted
from
8
IPF
lung
samples
and
7
healthy
controls
was
sequenced
on
an
Illumina
HiSeq
.

Analysis
of
differential
expression
and
exon
usage
was
performed
using
Bioconductor
packages
.

The
gene
periostin
was
selected
for
validation
of
alternative
splicing
by
quantitative
PCR
,
and
pathway
analysis
was
performed
to
determine
enrichment
for
differentially
expressed
and
spliced
genes
.

Results
:
There
were
873
genes
differentially
expressed
in
IPF
(
FDR
5
%
)
,
and
440
unique
genes
had
significant
differential
splicing
events
(
FDR
5
%
)
.

In
particular
,
cassette
exon
21
of
the
gene
periostin
was
significantly
more
likely
to
be
spliced
out
in
IPF
samples
(
adj
pval
=
2.06e-09
)
,
and
this
result
was
confirmed
by
qPCR
(
Wilcoxon
pval
=
3.11e-4
)
.

We
also
found
that
genes
close
to
SNPs
in
the
discovery
set
of
a
recent
IPF
GWAS
were
enriched
for
genes
differentially
expressed
in
our
data
,
including
genes
like
mucin5B
and
desmoplakin
which
have
been
previously
associated
with
IPF
.

Conclusions
:
There
is
significant
differential
splicing
and
expression
in
IPF
lung
samples
as
compared
with
healthy
controls
.

We
found
a
strong
signal
of
differential
cassette
exon
usage
in
periostin
,
an
extracellular
matrix
protein
whose
increased
gene
-
level
expression
has
been
associated
with
IPF
and
its
clinical
progression
,
but
for
which
differential
splicing
has
not
been
studied
in
the
context
of
IPF
.

Our
results
suggest
that
alternative
splicing
of
periostin
and
other
genes
may
be
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
IPF
.

The

culture
maintained
the
cancer
stemness
.

This
cancer
stemness
was
lost
when
the
CAF
feeder
cells
were
removed
during
passaging
.

To
investigate
the
specific
signaling
pathways
and
markers
of
lung
CSCs
,
we
analyzed
the
gene
expression
profile
of
the
CLS1
sphere
after
 
CLS1

culture
and
compared
this
profile
with
that
obtained
for

cultured
without

through

passages
(

generated

have
been
collected
for

We
tried
to

profiles
with
the
CLS1

2
p.3
,
p.6

Endometrial
cancer
is
one
of
the
most
common
gynecologic
malignancies
,
and
patients
with
high
grade
disease
,
especially
serous
papillary
subtype
(
SPEC
)
are
often
related
to
the
poor
outcomes
.

Recent
genome
-
wide
analyses
have
revealed
that
SPEC
exhibits
gene
expression
profiles
that
are
distinct
from
the
endometrioid
histologic
subtype
;
therefore
,
it
is
important
to
identify
the
SPEC
driver
genes
or
pathways
responsible
for
the
inherently
aggressive
phenotypes
and
to
develop
SPEC
-
specific
therapies
to
target
these
driver
genes
or
pathways
.

Through
array
-
based
analysis
and
immunohistochemical
staining
of
human
endometrial
cancer
tissue
,
STAT1
is
identified
high
expressed
,
and
can
distinguish
SPEC
from
other
subtypes
of
endometrial
cancer
.

In
vitro
and
in
vivo
experiments
show
STAT1
role
as
a
pro
-
survival
factor
in
SPEC
.

STAT1
was
identified
as
a
master
gene
modulating
–¢transcriptional
pro
-
survival
pathways–£
to
enhance
multiple
malignant
characteristics
 
These
finding
may
suggest
that
targeting
of
STAT1
,
the
SPEC
driver
gene
,
may
provide
the
means
to
improve
poor
outcomes
for
patients
with
SPEC
.

We
used
microarrays
to
clarify
the
changes
of
gene
expression
along
with
STAT1
-
siRNA
treatment
and
to
confirm
whether
there
are
any
changes
on
genes
expression
related
to
STAT1
pathway
.

We
also
used
the
microarray
data
to
clarify
genes
signatures
which
can
distinguish

of

cancers
.

In

Although
genetic
changes
in
Ewing
sarcoma
have
been
extensively
researched
,
our
understanding
of
the
role
of
epigenetic
modifications
in
this
neoplasm
is
limited
.

Procedure
:

In
an
effort
to
improve
our
knowledge
in
the
role
of
epigenetic
changes
in
Ewing
sarcoma
we
evaluated
the
in
vitro
antineoplastic
effect
of
the
DNA
methyltransferase
inhibitor
5
-
Aza
-
deoxycytidine
(
5
-
Aza
-
dC
)
and
identified
epigenetically
silenced
genes
by
pharmacologic
unmasking
of
DNA
methylation
coupled
with
genome
-
wide
expression
profiling
.

This
experiment
aims
to
study
transcriptional
alterations
induced
by
reconstitution
of
wild

E
-
cadherin
expression
in
human
lobular
breast
cancer
cells
harbouring
deleterious
,
somatic
CDH-1

Two

(
IPH-926
and
MDA
-
MB-134
)
expressing
synthetic
Ecad
(
EcadEGFP
)
or
not
(
EGFP
)
were
compared
against
each
other
.

Analysis
were
conducted
in
triplicates
(
IPH-926
)
and
quadruplicates
(
MDA

,
respectively
.

The
source
of
IFN-
_
in
ovarian
cancer
microenvironment
and
its
biological
effect
to
the
tumor
cells
is
unclear
.

The
immortalized
human
ovarian
surface
epithelial
cell
line
,
HOSE
-
E7
/
hTERT
(
HOSE
)
was
treated
with
IFN-
_
and
expression
microarray
analysis
was
performed
,
and
probes
showing
significantly
higher
values
in
IFN-_-added
group
were
termed
–¢IFN-
_
signature
genes
(
295
probes)–£.
 
We
then
applied
this
signature
to
our
ovarian
cancer
microarray
data
,
which
included
75
ovarian
cancer
clinical
samples
,
by
means
of
ss
-
GSEA
.

IFN-
_
signature
score
was
strongly
correlated
to
the
number
of
infiltrating
CD4
-
positive
or
CD8
-
positive
lymphocytes
in
the
tumors
.

These
data
suggest
that
the
IFN-
_
in
the
ovarian
cancer
microenvironment
is
derived
from
lymphocytes
,
and
an
IFN-_-rich
microenvironment
is
strongly
correlated
to
a
lymphocyte
-
rich
microenvironment
.

HOSE
cells
were
incubated
in
8
separate
culture
dishes
,
4
dishes
with
and
4
dishes
without
500
IU

ml
recombinant
human

(

)
in
the
culture
medium
for
6
hours
prior
to
the
analysis
.

Previous
work
has
shown
that
lung
tumors
and
normal
-
appearing
adjacent
lung
tissues
share
specific
abnormalities
that
may
be
highly
pertinent
to
the
pathogenesis
of
lung
cancer
.

However
,
the
global
and
molecular
adjacent
airway
field
cancerization
in
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
has
not
been
characterized
before
.

We
sought
to
understand
the
transcriptomic
architecture
of
the
adjacent
airway
field
canerization
,
in
conjunction
with
tumors
,
to
gain
additional
insights
into
the
lung
cancer
biology
and
oncogenesis
.

We
analyzed
the
transcriptome
,
using
the
Affymetrix
Human
Gene
1.0
ST
platform
,
of
matched
NSCLC
tumors
,
multiple
normal
airway
epithelia
with
differential
distance
from
the
tumors
as
well
as
uninvolved
normal
lung
tissues
.

We
analyzed
the
airway
field
cancerization
transcritpome
to
determine
global
differentially
expressed
cancerization
profiles
in
adjacent
airways
as
well
as
airway
profiles
that
may
be
modulated
by
distance
from
tumors
.

Turner
Syndrome
(
TS
)
is
the
most
common
X
chromosome
aneuploidy
disorder
in
female
,
and
the
predominant
karyotype
is
45X
,
a
complete
loss
of
the
second
sex
chromosome
.

 
Depending
on
the
parental
origin
of
the
single
X
chromosome
,
45X
patients
can
be
further
divided
into
two
groups
:
45Xm
and
45Xp
with
maternal
and
paternal
inherited
X
chromosome
,
respectively
.

 
TS
patients
of
45Xm
and
45Xp
are
found
to
associate
with
different
severity
in
phenotype
,
including
prevalence
for
cardiovascular
disease
.

To
study
parental
X
chromosome
impact
to
TS
phenotype
,
differential
gene
expression
in
PBMC
of
45Xm
and
45Xp
was
analyzed
by
microarray
.

Gene
expression
for
normal
female
46XX
was
also
analyzed
in
parallel
to
investigate
the
whole
genome
-
wide
gene
expression
changes
between
monosomy
X
TS
patients
and
normal
females
.

Activation
of
the
hypoxia
inducible
transcription
factor
HIF
-
alpha
and
the
NF
-
kappaB
pathway
promotes
inflammation
mediated
tumor
progression
.

The
cellular
transcription
factor
ZNF395
was
repeatedly
found
over
expressed
in
various
human
cancers
and
particularly
in
response
to
hypoxia
,
implying
a
functional
relevance
.

To
understand
the
biological
activity
of
ZNF395
,
we
identified
target
genes
of
ZNF395
by
a
genome
-
wide
expression
screen
.

Induced
ZNF395
expression
let
to
up
-
regulation
of
a
subset
of
interferon
(
IFN)-responsive
genes
such
as
IFIT1
/
ISG56
and
IFI44
as
well
as
genes
known
to
be
involved
in
cancer
progression
including
MEF2C
and
MACC1
.

ZNF395
requires
its
DNA
binding
domain
and
the
two
IFN
-
sensitive
-
response
elements
within
the
IFIT1
/
ISG56
promoter
to
activate
.

We
provide
evidence
that
IkBa
kinase
-
mediated
phosphorylation
is
required
to
allow
activation
of
transcription
by
ZNF395
but
simultaneously
accelerates
it
for
proteolytic
degradation
to
keep
the
activity
of
ZNF395
transient
and
weak
.

We
further
confirm
that
ZNF395
is
induced
by
hypoxia
.

Thus
,
two
crucial
pathways
contributing
to
cancers
progression
,
i.e.
hypoxia
and
inflammation
cooperate
in
activation
of
ZNF395
at
the
level
of
transcription
and
post
-
translational
modification
.

Increased
amounts
of
transcriptional
active
ZNF395
in
cancers
may
support
carcinogenesis
by
activating
its
target
genes
associated
with
the
innate
immune
response
and
cancer
.

4
samples
treated
with
doxycycline
-
induced
ZNF395
were
compared
to
4
untreated
controls

We
quantified
differential
gene
(
mRNA
)
expression
in
human
coronary
artery
cells
treated
with
native
HDL
,
reconstituted
HDL
,
lipid

apolipoprotein
A
-

,
small
unilamellar

,
or

.

These
data
were
used
to
determine
which
genes
are
regulated
by
native
HDL
compared
to
components
of
HDL
and
categorize
data
based
on
shared
sets
of
genes
and
distinct
sets
of
genes
regulated
by
each
component
.

Each
group
had
a
n=5
and
gene
expression
changes
for
each
condition
were
compared
to
control

from

HDAC
inhibitors
are
thought
to
regulate
gene
expression
by
post
-
translational
modification
of
histone
as
well
as
non

histone
proteins
.

Often
studied
at
single

,
increased
histone

is
the
paradigmatic

of

,
however
,
little
is
known

of

changes
of
the
mammalian
genome
when
stimulated
by
the
hydroxamic

,
TSA

.

In
primary
human
vascular
endothelial

we
map
the
chromatin
modifications
,
histone
H3
acetylation
of
lysine
9
and
14
(
H3K9/14ac
)
using
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
(
ChIP
)
coupled
with
massive
parallel
sequencing
(
ChIP
-

)
.

Since
acetylation
mediated
gene
expression
is
often
associated
with
modification
of
other
lysine
residues
we
also
examined
H3K4me3
and
H3K9me3
as
well
as
changes
in
CpG

(
CpG

)
.

Genome

indicates
the
differential
expression
of
about
30
%
of
genes
,
with
almost
equal

being
up-

down-
regulated
.

We
observe
deacetylation
conferred
by
TSA
and
SAHA
that
are
associated
with
decreased
gene
expression
.

Histone
deacetylation
is
associated
with
the
loss
of
p300
/
CBP
binding
at
gene
promoters
.

This
study
provides
an
important
framework
for
HDAC

in

and
a

Discrimination
of
rheumatoid

(

)
patients
from
patients
with

inflammatory

degenerative
joint
diseases
or
healthy
individuals
purely
on
the
basis
of
genes
differentially
expressed
in
high
-
throughput
data
has
proven
very
difficult
.

Thus
,
the
present
study
sought
to
achieve
such
discrimination
by
employing
a
novel
unbiased
approach
using
rule
-
based
classifiers
.

 
Three
multi

center
genome
-
wide
transcriptomic
data
sets
(
Affymetrix
HG-
U133
A
/
B
)
from
a
total
of
79
individuals
,
including
20
healthy
controls
(
control
group
-
CG
)
,
as
well
as
26
osteoarthritis
(
OA
)
and
33
RA
patients
,
were
used
to
infer
rule-
based
classifiers
to
discriminate
the
disease
groups
.

The
rules
were
ranked
with
respect
to
Kiendl–•s
statistical
relevance
index
,
and
the
resulting
rule
set
was
optimized
by
pruning
.

The
rule
sets
were
inferred
separately
from
data
of
one
of
three
centers
and
applied
to
the
two
remaining
centers
for
validation
.

All
rules
from
the
optimized
rule
sets
of
all
centers
were
used
to
analyze
their
biological
relevance
applying
the
software
Pathway
Studio
.

The
optimized
rule
sets
for
the
three
centers
contained
a
total
of
29
,
20
,
and
8
rules
(
including
10
,
8
,
and
4
rules
for
–§RA–•
)
,
respectively
.

The
mean
sensitivity
for
the
prediction
of
RA
based
on
six
center
-
to
-
center
tests
was
96
%
(
range
90
%
to
100
%
)
,
that
for
OA
86
%
(
range
40
%
to
100
%
)
.

The
mean
specificity
for
RA
prediction
was
94
%
(
range
80
%
to
100
%
)
,
that
for
OA
96
%
(
range
83.3
%
to
100
%
)
.

The
average
overall
accuracy
of
the
three
different
rule
-
based
classifiers
was
91
%
(
range
80
%
to
100
%
)
.

Unbiased
analyses
by
Pathway
Studio
of
the
gene
sets
obtained
by
discrimination
of
RA
from
OA
and
CG
with
rule
-
based
classifiers
resulted
in
the
identification
of
the
pathogenetically
and/or
therapeutically
relevant
interferon
-
gamma
and
GM
-
CSF
pathways
.

First
-
time
application
of
rule

based
classifiers
for
the
discrimination
of
RA
resulted
in
high
performance
,
with
means
for
all
assessment
parameters
close
to
or
higher
than
90
%
.

In
addition
,
this
unbiased
,
new
approach
resulted
in
the
identification
not
only
of
pathways
known
to
be
critical
to
RA
,
but
also
of
novel
molecules
such
as
serine

Invasive

cells
generate
three
splice
variants
of
the

gene
osteopontin
.

The
cancer

osteopontin

c
supports
anchorage

independence
through
inducing
oxidoreductases
and
upregulating
intermediates

enzymes
in
the
hexose
monophosphate
shunt
,
glutathione
cycle
,
glycolysis
,
glycerol
phosphate
shuttle
,
and
mitochondrial
respiratory
chain
.

Osteopontin
-
c
signaling
upregulates
glutathione
(
consistent
with
the
induction
of
the
enzyme
GPX-4
)
,
glutamine
and
glutamate
(
which
can
feed
into
the
tricarboxylic
acid
cycle
)
.

Consecutively
,
the
cellular
ATP
levels
are
elevated
.

The
elevated
creatine
may
be
synthesized
from
serine
via
glycine
and
also
supports
the
energy
metabolism
by
increasing
the
formation
of
ATP
.

Metabolic
probing
with
N

L
-
cysteine
,
L
-
glutamate
,
or
glycerol
identified
differentially
regulated
pathway
components
,
with
mitochondrial
activity
being
redox
dependent
and
the
creatine
pathway
depending
on
glutamine
.

The
effects
are
consistent
with
a
stimulation
of
the
energy
metabolism
that
supports
anti
-
anoikis
.

Our
findings
imply
a
synergism
in
cancer
cells
between
osteopontin
-
a
,
which
increases
the
cellular
glucose
levels
,
and
osteopontin
-

,
which
utilizes
this
glucose
to
generate
energy
.

,
focusing
in

on

and
three
plates
of
HCAECs
were
exposed
to
Vehicle

After
24
hours

RNA
was
extracted

was
analyzed

Mutations

have
been
identified
in
subsets

These
genetic

are
hypothesized
to
confer
an
oncogenic

significantly
in

The
percentage
of
C1q

expressing
CD14
positive
cells
is
significantly
increased
in
active

patients
.

C1q
expression
in
the

correlates
with

and
is
reduced
after

showed
that
C1qC

efficiently
discriminate

C1q

as
well
as

We
tested
the
hypothesis
on
the
mechanisms
responsible
for
the
early
control
of

function
by
identifying
a
discrete
set
of
genes
in
circulating
monocytes
that
were
altered
by
exercise
.

Exercise
leads
to
a
rapid
change
in
the
profile
of
gene
expression
in
monocytes
.

A

Breast
cancers
with
HER2
overexpression
are
sensitive
to
drugs
targeting
the
receptor
or
its
kinase
activity
.

HER2
-
targeting
drugs
are
initially
effective
against
HER2-
positive
breast
cancer
,
but
resistance
inevitably
occurs
.

We
previously
found
that
nuclear
factor
kappa
B
is
hyper
-
activated
in
the
subset
of
HER-2
positive
breast
cancer
cells
and
tissue
specimens
.

In
this
study
,
we
report
that
constitutively
active
NF-_B
rendered
HER2
-
positive
cancer
cells
resistant
to
anti
-
HER2
drugs
,
and
cells
selected
for
Lapatinib
resistance
up
-
regulated
NF-_B.

In
both
circumstances
,
cells
were
anti
-
apoptotic
and
grew
rapidly
as
xenografts
.

Lapatinib
-
resistant
cells
were
refractory
to
HER2
and
NF-_B
inhibitors
alone
but
were
sensitive
to
their
combination
,
suggesting
a
novel
therapeutic
strategy
.

A
subset
of
NF-_B
-
responsive
genes
was
overexpressed
in
HER2
-
positive
and
triple
-
negative
breast
cancers
,
and
patients
with
this
NF-_B
signature
had
poor
clinical
outcome
.

Anti
-
HER2
drug
resistance
may
be
a
consequence
of
NF-_B
activation
,
and
selection
for
resistance
results
in
NF-_B
activation
,
suggesting
this
transcription
factor
is
central
to
oncogenesis
and
drug
resistance
.

Clinically
,
the
combined
targeting
of
HER2
and
NF-_B
suggests
a
potential
treatment
paradigm
for
patients
who
relapse
after
anti
-
HER2
therapy
.

Patients
with
these
cancers
may
be
treated
by
simultaneously
suppressing
HER2
signaling
and
NF-_B
activation
.

oligonucleotide
microarray
consists
of
a
total
of
 
probes
covering
41,096
genes
of
human
.

Through
a
validation
study
,
total
RNA
isolated
from
liver
cells
were
used
for
comparison
of
gene
expression
profiles
via
microarray
examination
.

A
list
of
significantly
differentially
expressed
genes
was
generated
;
267
genes
were
 
up
-
regulated
genes
,
and
65
genes
were
 
down

.

The
Agilent

platform
is
based
upon
the
hybridization
of
a
single

sample
(
derived
from
RNA
)
,
followed
by
one

.

The
intensity
of
the
hybridization
signal
is
used
to
determine
target
concentration
.

In
order
to
validate
the
technical
quality
of
each
probe
in
our
arrays
,
we
carried
out
6
independent
hybridizations
on

To
examine
the

Pegylated
interferon-
_
(
pegIFN-
_
)
has
replaced
un
-
modified
recombinant
IFN-
_
for
the
treatment
of
chronic
viral
hepatitis
because
of
its
superior
anti
-
viral
efficacy
that
is
generally
attributed
to
improved
pharmacokinetic
properties
.

However
,
the
pharmacodynamic
effects
of
pegIFN-
_
in
the
liver
have
not
been
studied
.

We
analyzed
pegIFN-
_
induced
signaling
and
gene
regulation
in
paired
liver
biopsies
obtained
before
treatment
and
during
the
first
week
after
injection
of
pegIFN-
_
in
18
patients
.

Despite
sustained
high
serum
concentrations
of
pegIFN-
_
over
the
entire
one
-
week
dosing
interval
,
IFN-
_
signaling
through
the
Jak
-
STAT
pathway
occurs
only
during
the
first
day
.

PegIFN-
_
induces
hundreds
of
genes
that
can
be
classified
into
4
clusters
based
on
different
temporal
expression
profiles
.

In
all
clusters
,
gene
transcription
is
mainly
driven
by
IFN
stimulated
gene
factor
3
(
ISGF3
)
.

IFN
induced
secondary
transcription
factors
do
not
cause
additional
waves
of
gene
expression
.

We
could
not
confirm
a
role
of
un
-
phosphorylated
STAT1
in
prolonging
IFN-
_
induced
gene
transcription
.

Collectively
,
our
results
reveal
that
the
major
effects
of
pegIFN-
_
in
the
liver
are
caused
by
an
early
and
transient
activation
of
ISGF3
.

Prolonging
the
serum
half
-
life
of
IFN-
_
does
not
necessarily
improve
its
pharmacodynamic
properties
.

To

our
understanding
of

,
we
utilized
RNA

to

the

.

We
sequenced
polyadenylated

,
generating
an

.

Comparison
of
42
samples
*
examined
by
both
RNA

[

revealed
marked
differences
in

,
with
transcripts
identified
only
by
RNA

seq
having
much
lower
expression
than
those
also
identified
by

.

RNA

identified
many
more
differentially

transcripts
enriched
in
immune
system
processes
.

 
Weighted
gene
co

expression
network
analysis
(
WGCNA
)
revealed
multiple
modules
of
coordinately
expressed
epidermal
differentiation
genes
,
overlapping
significantly
with
genes
regulated
by
the
long
non

TINCR
,
its

,
staufen-1
(
STAU1
)
,
the
p63
target
gene
ZNF750
,
and
its
target
KLF4
.

Other
coordinately
expressed
modules
were
enriched
for
lymphoid
and/or
myeloid
signature
transcripts
and
genes
induced
by
IL-17
in
keratinocytes
.

Dermally
-
expressed
genes
were
significantly
down
-
regulated
in
psoriatic
biopsies
,
most
likely
due
to
expansion
of
the
epidermal
compartment
.

These
results
demonstrate
the
power
of
WGCNA
to
elucidate
gene
regulatory
circuits
in
psoriasis
,
and
emphasize
the
influence
of
tissue
architecture
in
both
differential

analysis
.

significantly
affect
the

Invasive
lobular
carcinoma
(
ILC
)
is
a
histological
subtype
of
breast
cancer
that
is
frequently
associated
with
favorable
outcomes
,
as
~90
%
of
ILC
express
the
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
.

However
,
recent
retrospective
analyses
suggest
that
ILC
patients
receiving
adjuvant
endocrine
therapy
may
not
benefit
from
improved
outcomes
versus
other

patients
.

Based
on
these
observations
,
we
characterized
ER
function
and
endocrine

in
ILC
models
.

The
ER

and
SUM44PE
were
used
to
examine
the
ER

transcriptome
in

via
gene

microarray
analyses
and
ER
ChIP

.

 
In

,
estrogen

was
assessed
in

in
the

derived
ILC
xenograft
HCI-013
.

Response
to
endocrine
therapy
was
also
examined
in
ILC
cell
lines
.

We
identified
915
genes
that
were
uniquely
E2
-
regulated
in
ILC
cell
lines
versus
other
breast
cancer
cell
lines
,
and
a
subset
of
these
genes
were
also
regulated
in

in
HCI-013
.

We
observed
that
MM134
were
de
novo
tamoxifen
resistant
,
and
were
induced
to
grow
by
4
-
hydroxytamoxifen
,
as
well
as
other
anti

estrogens
,
as
partial
agonists
.

Growth
was
accompanied
by
agonist
activity
of
tamoxifen
on
ER
-
mediated
gene
expression
.

Though
tamoxifen
induced
cell
growth
,
MM134
cells
required
FGFR1
signaling
to
maintain
viability
and
were
sensitive
to
combined
endocrine
therapy
and
FGFR1
inhibition
.

Our
observation
that
ER
drives
a
unique
program
of
gene
expression
in
ILC
cells
correlates
with
the
ability
of
tamoxifen
to
induce
growth
in
these
cells

Targeting
growth
factors

may
block
survival

RNA
-
sequencing
(
RNA
-
seq
)
is
a
powerful
technique
to
investigate
the
complexity
of
gene
expression
in
the
human
brain
.

We
used
RNA
-
seq
to
survey
the
brain
transcriptome
in
high
-
quality
post
-
mortem
dorsolateral
prefrontal
cortex
from
11
individuals
diagnosed
with
bipolar
disorder
(
BD
)
and
from
11
age-
and
gender
-
matched
controls
.

 
Deep
sequencing
was
performed
,
with
over
350
million
reads
per
specimen
.

At
a
false
-
discovery
rate
of
<
5
%
,
we
detected
5
differentially
-
expressed
(
DE
)
genes
and
12
DE
transcripts
,
most
of
which
have
not
been
previously
implicated
in
BD
.

 
Among
these
,
PROM1
/
CD133
and
ABCG2
play
important
roles
in
neuroplasticity
.

We
also
show
for
the
first
time
differential
expression
of
long
non
-
coding
RNAs
(
lncRNAs
)
in
BD
.

 
DE
transcripts
include
those
of
SRSF5
and
RFX4
,
which
along
with
lncRNAs
play
a
role
in
mammalian
circadian
rhythms
.

The
DE
genes
were
significantly
enriched
for
several
Gene
Ontology
(
GO
)
categories
.

Of
these
,
genes
involved
with
GTPase
binding
were
also
enriched
for
BD
-
associated
SNPs
from
previous
genome
-
wide
association
studies
,
suggesting
that
differential
expression
of
these
genes
is
not
simply
a
consequence
of
BD
or
its
treatment
.

 
Many
of
these
findings
were
replicated
by
microarray
in
an
independent
sample
of
60
cases
and
controls
.

These
results
highlight
common
pathways
for
inherited
and
non
-
inherited
influences
on
disease
risk
that
may
constitute
good
targets
for
novel
therapies
.

Brain
transcriptome
in
bipolar
disorder

Motivation
:
RNA
-
seq
is
replacing
microarrays
as
the
primary
tool
for
gene
expression
studies
.

Many
RNA
-
seq
studies
have
used
insufficient
biological
replicates
,
resulting
in
low
statistical
power
and
inefficient
use
of
sequencing
resources
.

Results
:
We
show
the
explicit
trade
-
off
between
more
biological
replicates
and
deeper
sequencing
in
increasing
power
to
detect
differentially
expressed
(
DE
)
genes
.

In
the
human
cell
line
MCF-7
,
adding
more
sequencing
depth
after
10
M
reads
gives
diminishing
returns
on
power
to
detect
DE
genes
,
while
adding
biological
replicates
improves
power
significantly
regardless
of
sequencing
depth
.

We
also
propose
a
cost
-
effectiveness
metric
for
guiding
the
design
of
large
scale
RNA
-
seq
DE
studies
.

Our
analysis
showed
that
sequencing
less
reads
and
perform
more
biological
replication
is
an
effective
strategy
to
increase
power
and
accuracy
in
large
scale
differential
expression

multi

formed
in

.

In
ovarian
cancer
(
OC
)
,
they
serve
as
a
vehicle
for
cancer
cell
dissemination
in
the
peritoneal
cavity
.

We
investigated
genes
and
networks
upregulated
in
three
dimensional
(
3D
)
versus
two
-
dimensional
(
2D
)
culture
conditions
by
Affymetrix
gene
expression
profiling
and
identified
ALDH1A1
,
a
cancer
stem
cell
marker
as
being
upregulated
in
OC
spheroids
.

Network
analysis
confirmed
ALDH1A1
upregulation
in
spheroids
in
direct
connection
with
elements
of
the
beta
-
catenin
pathway
.

A
parallel
increase
in
the
expression
levels
of
beta
-
catenin
and
ALDH1A1
was
demonstrated
in
spheroids
vs.
monolayers
an
in
successive
spheroid
generations
by
using
OC
cell
liness
and
primary
OC
cells
.

The
percentage
of
Aldefluor
positive
cells
was
significantly
higher
in
spheroids
vs.
monolayers
in
IGROV1
,
A2780
,
SKOV3
,
and
primary
OC
cells
.

B
-
catenin
knock
-
down
decreased
ALDH1A1
expression
and
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
demonstrated
that
beta
-
catenin
directly
binds
to
the
ALDH1A1
promoter
.

Both
siRNA
mediated
beta
-
catenin
knock
-
down
and
a
novel
ALDH1A1
small

enzymatic
inhibitor
described
here
for
the
first
time
,
decreased
the
number
of
OC
spheroids
(
p<0.001
)
and
cell
viability
.

These
data
strongly
support
the
role
of
beta
-
catenin
regulated
ALDH1A1
in
the
maintenance
of
OC
spheroids
and
of
a
stem
cell
phenotype
and
propose
new
ALDH1A1
inhibitors
targeting
this
cell
population
.

Nine
samples
were
analyzed
in

.

Each

is
a

Currently
there
is
a

for
patients
presenting
with
advanced

(
ccRCC
)
.

This
is
due
in
part
to
a
lack
of
molecular
factors
which
can
be
targeted
pharmacologically
.

In
order
to
identify
novel
tumor

targets
,
we
performed
high
throughput
gene
array
analysis
screening
numerous
patient
ccRCC
tumor
tissues
across
all
stages
of
disease
,
and
compared
their
gene
expression
levels
to
matched
normal
kidney
.

Our
results
identify
a
number
of
genes
which
demonstrate
tumor

,
and
may
present
as
novel
targets
for
therapy
.

Patient

were
sorted
into

was
extracted
from

was
performed

Here
,
we
report
a
novel

Hepatitis
E
virus
(
HEV
)
is
an
important
causative
pathogen
of
acute
hepatitis
.

Because
of
the
absence
of
an
in

culture
system
for
HEV
,
research
has
been
greatly
impeded
.

And
interaction
between
HEV
and
host
cells
was
mainly
studied
by
tansfection

,
such
as
Adeno

.

We
developed
an
in

system
for
HEV
in
PLC

cells
.

With
this
in

system
,
we
studied
the

Using

,
we
analysed

of
PLC

,
whose
transcription
level
could
be
changed

Five

were
used
as

,
and
five

Rationale
:
Asthma
is
a
chronic
inflammatory
airway
disease
.

The
most
common
medications
used
for
its
treatment
are
_
2
-
agonists
and
glucocorticosteroids
,
and
one
of
the
primary
tissues
that
these
drugs
target
in
the
treatment
of
asthma
is
the
airway
smooth
muscle
.

We
used
RNA

Seq
to
characterize
the
human
airway
smooth
muscle
(
HASM
)
transcriptome
at
baseline
and
under
three
asthma
treatment
conditions
.

Methods
:
The

was
used
to
prepare
75bp

for
HASM
cells
from
four
white

(
i.e.

)
;
3
)
treatment
with
a
glucocorticosteroid
(
i.e.
Dexamethasone
(
Dex
)
,
1_M
for
18h
)
;
4
)
simultaneous
treatment
with
a
_
2

and
glucocorticoid
,
and
the
libraries
were
sequenced
with
an

.

The
Tuxedo

were
used
to
align

The
B

cell
receptor
(
BCR
)
plays
an
important
role
in
pathogenesis
and
progression
of
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
(
CLL
)
.

We
investigated
the
BCR
triggering
-
dependent
mRNA
modulation
by
stimulating
CLL
cells
with
immobilized
anti
-
IgM.
miRome
of
immobilized
anti

IgM
stimulated
CLL
cells
(
n=16
)
identified
a
substantial
upregulation
of
miR-132
in
both
unmutated
(
UM
)
and
mutated
(
M
)
IGHV
subgroups
.

A
parallel
gene
expression
profile
and
an
in
-
silico
analysis
to
identify
miR-132
target
genes—å
allowed
us
to
focus
on
SIRT1
,
that
encodes
for
a
histone
deacetylase
targeting
several
proteins
including
TP53
.

We
defined
a
reduction
of
SIRT1
protein
levels
upon
immobilized
anti
-
IgM
stimulation
(
P=0.001
)
,
and
a
concomitant
increase
in
TP53
acetylation
(
P=0.0072
)
.

The
TP53
target
gene
CDKN1A
was
consistently
up
-
regulated
in
immobilized
anti
-
IgM
stimulated
CLL
cells
.

Of
note
,
the
miR-132
constitutive
expression
levels
in
CLL
cases
(
n=134
)
were
of
similar
magnitude
of
those
obtained
in
in
vitro
immobilized
anti
-
IgM
stimulated
CLL
cells
.

 
Additionally
,
high
miR-132
expression
levels
retained
a
favorable
prognostic
impact
in
M
(
P=0.005
)
,
but
not
in
UM
CLL
patients
(
P=0.968
)
.

The

sequentially
characterized
by
BCR
triggering
,
miR-132
up

,
should
be
considered
in

Tumors
that
show
evidence
of
epithelial
to
mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
have
been
associated
with
metastasis
,
drug
resistance
,
and
poor
prognosis
.

 
EMT
may
alter
the
molecular
requirements
for
growth
and
survival
in
different
contexts
,
but
the
underlying
mechanisms
remain
incomplete
.

 
Given
the
heterogeneity
along
the
EMT
spectrum
between
and
within
tumors
it
is
important
to
define
the
requirements
for
growth
and
survival
in
cells
with
an
epithelial
or
mesenchymal
phenotype
to
maximize
therapeutic
efficacy
.

We
have
established
an
inducible
cell
line
model
in
which
a
tamoxifen
regulatable
Twist
-
ER
fusion
protein
is
stably
expressed
in
the
H358
non

small
cell
lung
cancer
cell
line
.

 
Upon
tamoxifen
addition
,
cells
undergo
EMT
and
provide
a
system
in
which
we
can
compare
the
growth
and
survival
requirements
directly
related
to
EMT
,
removing
confounding
factors
present
when
comparing
different
cell
lines
.

or
TwistER
were
treated
for
12
days
in

followed
by

.

Three

were
collected
.

therefore
,

Since
the

that

sufficed
for
the

,
methodologies
replacing
the

have
enhanced
our
understanding
of
the

.

However
,
unlike
in

,
OCT4
has
not
been
replaced
successfully
during

of
human

.

Here
we
report
on
a
strategy
to
do
so

Through
a

we

that
are
able
to

Our

that
is
possible
to
replace

simultaneously
with
alternative
lineage
specifiers
in
the

of

marker
Sox2
(

)
has
been
observed
in
stomach
cancer
.

However
,
the
role
of
Sox2
in
gastric
tumors
has
not
been
well
established
to
date
.

To
elucidate
the
role
of
Sox2
in
gastric
tumorigenesis
,
Sox2
transcriptional
activity
was
blocked
in
AZ521
cells
.

Interestingly
,
inhibition
of
Sox2
reduced
cell
proliferation
and
migration
,
increased
apoptosis
and
induced
changes
in
cell
cycle
.

Blocking
of
Sox2
also
reduced
the
tumorigenic
potential
of
AZ521
cells
in
vivo
.

In
addition
,
correlation
of
Sox2
expression
and
proliferation
was
observed
in
a
subset
of
human
gastric
tumours
.

Finally
,
target
genes
of
Sox2
were
for
the
first
time
identified
by
RNA
microarray
in
gastric
cancer
cells
.

Taken
together
,
the
results
presented
here
indicate
that
Sox2
controls
several
aspects
related
to
gastric
cancer
development
and
progression
by
regulating
the
expression
of
members
of
important
signalling
pathways
.

These
findings
could
provide
new
therapeutic
options
for
a
subset
of
gastric
cancers
exhibiting
Sox2
deregulation
.

Advanced

is
the
most

malignancy
in
the
United

.

Ovarian
cancer
cells
are
known
to
have
diminished
response
to
TGF
-
beta
,
but
it
remains
unclear
whether
TGF
-
beta
can
modulate
ovarian
cancer
cell
growth
in
an
indirect
manner
through
cancer
-
associated
fibroblasts
(
CAFs
)
.

Using
transcriptome
profiling
analyses
on
TGF

beta
-
treated
ovarian
fibroblasts
,
we
identified
a
TGF

beta
-
responsive
gene
signature
in
ovarian
fibroblasts
.

Identifying
TGF

genes
in
the
ovarian
microenvironment
helps
in
understanding
the
role
of
TGF

in
ovarian

.

The

aim
of
reducing

followed
by

with

,
which

.

However
,
Abdominal

rates
are
high
and
response
to

is
limited
.

 
Attempts
at
introducing
biologic

agents
to
improve

in
this
disease
are
ongoing
,
while
prognostic
or
predictive
biomarkers
that
can
stratify
patients
for

are
still
lacking
.

Using
transcriptome
profiling
of
microdissected
tissue
samples
from
high

grade
serous
ovarian
cancer
patients
,
we
identified
a
cancer
associated

)
specific
gene
signature
.

Versican
,
which
encodes
a
extracellular
matrix
protein
,
was
one
of
the
identified
genes
which
demonstrated
up

regulation
in
cancer
stroma
.

To
investigate
the
function

,
signaling

and
the
effect
of
versican
treatment
on
ovarian
cancer
cells
,
transcriptome
profiling
of
versican

cells
was
performed
.

High

was
used
.

Total

at
48

followed

.

Samples
were
then
hybridized
onto

For

,
three
independent
samples
were
prepared
for
the

CD4(+

T
regulatory
(
Tr1
)
cells
are
induced
in
the
periphery
and
have
a
pivotal
role
in
promoting
and
maintaining
tolerance
.

The
absence
of
surface
markers
that
uniquely
identify
Tr1
cells
has
limited
their
study
and
clinical
applications
.

By
gene
expression
profiling
of
human
Tr1
cell
clones
,
we
identified
the
surface
markers
CD49b
and
lymphocyte
activation
gene
3
(
LAG-3
)
as
being
stably
and
selectively
coexpressed
on
mouse
and
human
Tr1
cells
.

We
showed
the
specificity
of
these
markers
in
mouse
models
of
intestinal
inflammation
and
helminth
infection
and
in
the
peripheral
blood
of
healthy
volunteers
.

The
coexpression
of
CD49b
and
LAG-3
enables
the
isolation
of
highly
suppressive
human
Tr1
cells
from
in

anergized
cultures
and
allows
the
tracking
of
Tr1
cells
in
the
peripheral
blood
of
subjects
who
developed
tolerance
after
allogeneic
hematopoietic
stem
cell
transplantation
.

The
use
of
these
markers
makes
it
feasible
to
track
Tr1
cells
in
vivo
and
purify
Tr1
cells
for
cell
therapy
to
induce
or
restore
tolerance
in
subjects
with

To

We
identified

.

To
investigate
the
underlying
mechanism
by
which
TIG1
promotes
tumor
growth
and
invasiveness
of

cells
,
we
first
sought
to
identify

by
using
DNA

to
compare
gene

profiles
between
SUM149

We
identified

as
a
functional
partner
of
TIG1
.

SUM149
cells
transiently

Down

(
trisomy
21
)
is
the
most
common
viable
chromosomal
disorder
with
intellectual

and
several
other
developmental
abnormalities
.

Here
,
we
report
the
generation
and
characterization
of
induced
pluripotent
stem
cells
(
iPSCs
)
derived
from
monozygotic
twins
discordant
for
trisomy
21
in
order
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
the
variability
of
genomic
background
.

The
alterations
observed
by
genetic
analysis
at
the
iPSC
level
and
at
first
approximation
in
early
development
illustrate
the
developmental
disease
transcriptional
signature
of
Down
syndrome
.

Moreover
,
we
observed
an
abnormal
neural
differentiation
of
Down
syndrome
iPSCs
in
vivo
when
formed
teratoma
in
NOD
-
SCID
mice
,
and
in

when
differentiated
into
neuroprogenitors
and
neurons
.

These
defects
were
associated
with
changes
in
the
architecture
and
density
of
neurons
,
astroglial
and
oligodendroglial
cells
together
with
misexpression
of
genes
involved
in
neurogenesis
,
lineage

.

Furthermore
,
we
provide
novel
evidence
that
dual

specificity
tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation
regulated
kinase
1A
(
DYRK1A
)
on
chromosome
21
likely
contribute
to
these
defects
.

Importantly
,
we
found
that
targeting
DYRK1A
pharmacologically
or
by
shRNA
results
in
a
considerable
correction
of
these
defects
.

approach
to

and
test
genes
in

that
are
both
induced
upon
interaction
with
basal

cancer
cells
in
culture
and
upregulated
in
stromal
cells
from
primary
human
breast
cancers
.

 
Several
of
the
upregulated
genes
encode
secreted
growth
factors
or
cytokines
.

 
Using
RNAi
and
a

assay
,
we
determined
that
the
majority
of
secreted
factors
selected
for
functional
validation
played
significant
,
yet
functionally
diverse
,
roles
in
promoting
tumorigenicity
.

 
Rather
than
a
single
major
mediator
,
these
results
indicate
multiple
points
of
intervention
to
prevent
fibroblasts
from
supporting
basal

cancer
.

 
Additionally
,
we
show
that
breast

subtypes
differ
markedly
in
the

of
these
and
other
stromally
secreted
proteins

Discoid
lupus
erythematosus
(
DLE
)
is
the
most
common
skin
manifestation
of
lupus
.

Despite
its
high
frequency
in
systemic
lupus
in
addition
to
cases
without
extracutaneous
manifestations
,
targeted
treatments
for
DLE
are
lacking
,
likely
because
of
a
dearth
of
knowledge
of
the
molecular
landscape
of
DLE
skin
.

Here
,
we
profiled
the
transcriptome
of
DLE
skin
in
order
to
identify
signaling
pathways
and
cellular
signatures
that
may
be
targeted
for
treatment
purposes
.

Further
comparison
of
the
DLE
transcriptome
with
that
of
psoriasis
,
a
useful
reference
given
our
extensive
knowledge
of
molecular
pathways
in
this
disease
,
provided
a
framework
to
identify
potential
therapeutic
targets
.

Although
a
growing
body
of
data
support
a
role
for
IL-17
and
T
helper
type
17
(
Th17
)
cells
in
systemic
lupus
,
we
show
a
relative
enrichment
of
IFN
-
–û—ñ
-
associated
genes
without
that
for
IL-17
-
associated
genes
in
DLE
.

Extraction
of
T
cells
from
the
skin
of
DLE
patients
identified
a
predominance
of
IFN
-
–û—ñ
-
producing
Th1
cells
and
an
absence
of
IL-17
-
producing
Th17
cells
,
complementing
the
results
from
whole

skin
transcriptomic
analyses
.

These
data
therefore
support
investigations
into
treatments
for

It
has
been
suggested
that
breast
cancers
are
driven
and
maintained
by
a
cellular
subpopulation
with
stem
cell
properties
.

These
breast
cancer
stem
cells
(
BCSCs
)
mediate
metastasis
and
by
virtue
of
their
resistance
to
radiation
and
chemotherapy
,
contribute
to
relapse
.

 
Although
several
BCSC
markers
have
been
described
,
it
is
unclear
whether
these
markers
identify
the
same
or
independent
BCSC
populations
.

Based
on
established
breast
cancer
cell
lines
,
as
well
as
primary
tumor
samples
and
xenografts
,
we
show
that
BCSCs
exist
in
distinct
mesenchymal
-
like
(
epithelial
-
mesenchymal
transition
,
EMT
)
and
epithelial
-
like
(
mesenchymal
-
epithelial
transition
,
MET
)
states
characterized
by
expression
of
distinct
markers
,
proliferative
capacity
and
invasive
characteristics
.

The
gene
expression
profiles
of
mesenchymal
-
like
and
epithelial
-
like
BCSCs
are
remarkably
similar
across
the
different
molecular
subtypes
of
breast
cancer
and
resemble
those
of
distinct
basal
and
luminal
stem
cells
found
in
the
normal
breast
.

We
propose
that
the
plasticity
of
BCSCs
allowing
them
to
transition
between
EMT-
and
MET
-
like
states
endows
these
cells
with
the
capacity
for
tissue
invasion
,
dissemination
and
growth
at
metastatic
sites
.

Breast
cancer
cells
from

were
sorted
using
flow

to
select
for
cells
that
were

Gene

profiles
of
these
cells
were
compared
with

of

.

Goal
:
To
define
the
digital
transcriptome
of
three
breast
cancer
subtypes
(
TNBC
,
Non
-
TNBC
,
and
HER2
-
positive
)
using
RNA
-
sequencing
technology
.

To
elucidate
differentially
expressed
known
and
novel
transcripts
,
alternatively
spliced
genes
and
differential
isoforms
and
lastly
expressed
variants
in
our
dataset
.

Method
:
Dr.
Suzanne
Fuqua
(
Baylor
College
of
Medicine
)
provided
the
human
breast
cancer
tissue
RNA
samples
.

All
of
the
human
samples
were
used
in
accordance
with
the
IRB
procedures
of
Baylor
College
of
Medicine
.

The
breast
tumour
types
,
TNBC
,
Non
-
TNBC
and
HER2
-
positive
,
were
classified
on
the
basis
of
immunohistochemical
and
RT
-
qPCR
classification
.

Results
:
Comparative
transcriptomic
analyses
elucidated
differentially
expressed
transcripts
between
the
three
breast
cancer
groups
,
identifying
several
new
modulators
of
breast
cancer
.

We
discovered
subtype
specific
differentially
spliced
genes
and
splice
isoforms
not
previously
recognized
in
human
transcriptome
.

Further
,
we
showed
that
exon
skip
and
intron
retention
are
predominant
splice
events
in
breast
cancer
.

In
addition
,
we
found
that
differential
expression
of
primary
transcripts
and
promoter
switching
are
significantly
deregulated
in
breast
cancer
compared
to
normal
breast
.

 
We
also
report
novel
expressed
variants
,
allelic
prevalence
and
abundance
,
and
coexpression
with
other
variation
,
and
splicing
signatures
.

Additionally
we
describe
novel
SNPs
and
INDELs
in
cancer
relevant
genes
with
no
prior
reported
association
of
point
mutations
with
cancer
mRNA

of
17
breast
tumor
samples
of

different
subtypes
(

and
HER2

positive
)
and

were

Immunity
to
malaria
can
be
acquired
through
natural
exposure
to
Plasmodium
falciparum
(
Pf
)
,
but
only
after
years
of
repeated
infections
.

Typically
,
this
immunity
is
acquired
by
adolescence
and
confers
protection
against
disease
,
but
not
Pf
infection
per
se
.

Efforts
to
understand
the
mechanisms
of
this
immunity
are
integral
to
the
development
of
a
vaccine
that
would
mimic
the
induction
of
adult
immunity
in
children
.

The
current
study
applies
transcriptomic
analyses
to
a
cohort
from
the
rural
village
of
Kalifabougou
,
Mali
,
where
Pf
transmission
is
intense
and
seasonal
.

Signatures
that
correlate
with
protection
from
malaria
may
yield
new
hypotheses
regarding
the
biological
mechanisms
through
which
malaria
immunity
is
induced
by
natural
Pf
infection
.

The
resulting
datasets
will
be
of
considerable
value
in
the
urgent
worldwide
effort
to
develop
a
malaria
vaccine
that
could
prevent
more
than
a
million
deaths
annually
.

Amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
(
ALS
)
is
a
severe
neurodegenerative
condition
characterized
by
loss
of
motor
neurons
in
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
.

Expansions
of
a
hexanucleotide
repeat
(
GGGGCC
)
in
the
noncoding
region
of
the
C9ORF72
gene
are
the
most
common
cause
of
the
familial
form
of
ALS
(
C9
-
ALS
)
,
as
well
as
frontotemporal
lobar
degeneration
and
other
neurological
diseases
.

How
the
repeat
expansion
causes
disease
remains
unclear
,
with
both
loss
of
function
(
haploinsufficiency
)
and
gain
of
function
(
either
toxic
RNA
or
protein
products
)
proposed
.

We
report
a
cellular
model
of
C9
-
ALS
with
motor
neurons
differentiated
from
induced
pluripotent
stem
cells
(
iPSCs
)
derived
from
ALS
patients
carrying
the
C9ORF72
repeat
expansion
.

No
significant
loss
of
C9ORF72
expression
was
observed
,
and
knockdown
of
the
transcript
was
not
toxic
to
cultured
human
motor
neurons
.

Transcription
of
the
repeat
was
increased
,
leading
to
accumulation
of
GGGGCC

repeat–†containing
RNA
foci
selectively
in

iPSC
-

colocalized
with

and
Pur-
_
,
suggesting
that
they
may
be
able
to

metabolism
.

C9
-
ALS
motor
neurons
showed
altered
expression
of
genes
involved
in
membrane
excitability
including
DPP6
,
and
demonstrated
a
diminished
capacity
to
fire
continuous
spikes
upon
depolarization
compared
to
control
motor
neurons
.

Antisense
oligonucleotides
targeting
the
C9ORF72
transcript
suppressed
RNA
foci
formation
and
reversed
gene
expression
alterations
in
C9
-
ALS
motor

.

These
data
show
that
patient

can
be
used
to
delineate
pathogenic
events
in

.

Results

.

We
subjected
brain

to
microarray
to
determine
the
genes
involved
in
BTICs
growth
and
differentiation
when
exposed
to
microglia

medium
(

)
for
6h
.

BTICs
were
grown
in
MCM
or

for
6h
,
and
media
was
removed
and
then
the
cells
were
subjected
for

and
hybridization
on

microarrays
.

Three

were
generated

The
overall
objective
was
to

ETS2
is
a
canonical
transcriptional
factor
and
member
of
the
ETS
family
of
genes
.

ETS2
binds
to
consensus
ERE
binding
sites
in
a
broad
spectrum
of
genes
thus
affecting
many
intracellular
molecular
functions
.

However
,
the
role
of
ETS2
in
the
biology
and
pathogenesis
of
lung
cancers
is
still
not
known
.

We
have
found
that
ETS2
is
down
-
regulated
in
lung
tumors
compared
to
normal
lung
tissue
and
the
expression
of
the
coding
protein
of
the
gene
was
a
significant
independent
predictor
of
favorable
outcome
in
NSCLC
patients
pinpointing
to
a
potential
tumor
suppressor
role
for
this
gene
.

To
better
understand
its
molecular
function
in
NSCLC
,
we
compared
and
contrasted
the
transcriptome
of
lung
cancer
cells
transfected
with
control
siRNA
and
siRNA
targeting
ETS2
.

H441
lung
cancer
cells
were
transfected
with

.

Three
independent

were
performed

with

and
for

to
ETS2
where
each

consittutes

we
supplemented

Exposure

we
studied
through

We
found
that
22/26
harbored

cells
were
treated
for
120hours
with
1000¬µM
zebularine
(

.

Zebularine
acts
as
a
DNA
methyltransferase
(

)
inhibitor
thereby
upregulating
genes
that
are
inactivated
by
e.g.

.

The
experiment
aimed
to
search
for
upregulated

to
provide

.

308

Using
gene

microarrays
,
we
found
that
when

or
MTX
plus
a

was
compared
with

,
there
were
notable
differences
in

,
demonstrating
that

is
not
a
restoration
of
immunologic

.

Differences
were
detected
in

as
well
as
in

The

(

)
is
amplified
and
overexpressed
in
approximately
20
%
of
invasive
breast
cancers
and
is
associated
with
metastasis
and

.

Here
we
describe
the
role
of
a
constitutively
active
splice
variant
of
HER2
(
Delta
-
HER2
)
in
human
mammary
epithelial
cells
.

Overexpression
of
Delta

HER2
in
human
mammary
cells
decreased
apoptosis
and
increased
proliferation
and
expression
of
epithelial

to
-
mesenchymal
markers
.

It
also
induced
invasion
in
three
-
dimensional
cultures
and
promoted
tumorigenicity
and
metastasis
in

.

In
contrast
,
similar
overexpression
of
wild

type
HER2
failed
to
evoke
the

effects
.

Unbiased

revealed
a
significant
increase
in

of
several
key

upon
Delta

expression
,
some
of
which
not
previously
shown
to
belong
to
the
HER2
pathway
.

In
addition
,
microarray
analysis
revealed
the
expression
of
a
set
of
genes
specifically
associated
with
Delta

.

We
found
those
genes
to
be
highly
expressed
in
ER
-
negative

high

and
metastatic

.

Altogether
,
these
results
provide

was
conducted
in

In

Differentiation
in
the

suggesting
that

We
performed

data
to
investigate
the
effects
of

Chronic
Lymphocytic
Leukemia
(
CLL
)
cells
multiply
in
secondary
lymphoid
tissue
but
the
mechanisms
leading
to
their
proliferation
are
still
uncertain
.

In
addition
to
BCR
-
triggered
signals
,
other
microenvironmental
factors
might
well
be
involved
.

In
proliferation
centres
,
leukemic
B
cells
are
in
close
contact
with
CD4+CD40L+–öT
cells
.

Therefore
,
we
here
dissected
the
signals
provided
by
autologous
activated
T
cells
(
Tact
)
to
CLL
cells
.

Although
the
gene
expression
profile
induced
by
Tact
was
highly
similar
to
that
induced
by
sole
CD40
signaling
,
an
obvious
difference
was
that
Tact
induced
proliferation
of
CLL
cells
.

We
determined
that
stimulation
with
only
CD40L+IL-21
was
sufficient
to
induce
robust
proliferation
in
CLL
cells
.

We
then
defined
an
IL-21
-
induced
gene
signature
in
CLL
,
containing
components
of
JAK
-
STAT
and
apoptosis
pathways
,
and
this
signature
could
be
detected
in
lymph
node
(
LN
)
samples
from
patients
.

Finally
,
we
could
detect
IL-21
RNA
and
protein
in
LN
,
and
IL-21
production–öex
vivo–öby
LN
CD4+CXCR5
+

cells
.

These
results
indicate
that
,
in
addition
to
BCR
signaling
,
activated
T
cells
might
contribute
to
CLL
cell
proliferation
via
CD40
and
IL-21
.

Targeting
these
signaling
pathways
might
offer
new
venues
for
treatment
of
CLL.–ö
CLL
cells
were
cultured
under

therapy
(
AAT
)
is
standard

when
over

Likewise
,
knockdown
of

restricts
the

.

 
We
sought
to
identify
specfic

during
the
process
of

in
U937
by
performing

We
used

to
identify
genes
regulated
by
ZXDC
during
PMA
-

differentiation
of
U937
monoblasts
towards
a

was
established
in
the

that
displayed

Using

we
created

REST
has
been
initially
described
as
a
repressor
of
neuronal
genes
in
non

neuronal
cells
by
binding
to
its

sequence
RE1
.

Over

activation
of
this
factor
has
been
shown
in
several
diseases
such
as
Huntington
disease
or
central

cancers
.

High

screening
of
a
library
of
6,984
compounds
with
luciferase
-
assay
measuring
REST
activity
in
neural
derivatives
of
human
embryonic
stem
cells
led
to
the
identification
of
one
benzoimidazole-5
-
carboxamide
derivative
(
X5050
)
that
inhibited
REST
silencing
in
a
RE1

manner
.

Differential
transcriptomic
analysis
revealed
the
upregulation
of
neuronal
genes
targeted
by

Salivary
gland
adenoid
cystic
carcinoma
(
ACC
)
is
a
rare
malignancy
amongst
head
and
neck
tumors
that
is
poorly
understood
on
a
molecular
level
.

We
sought
to
perform
a
comprehensive
approach
for
novel
oncogene
candidate
screening
under
the
control
of
promoter
methylation
in
order
to
learn
more
about
the
molecular
basis
of
this
unusual
disease
.

We
performed
global
demethylation
of
normal
salivary
gland
cell
strains
using
5
-
aza
-
deoxycytidine
(
5

)
and
trichostatin
(
TSA
)
.

Expression
arrays
were
performed
,
and
the
profiles
of
treated
and
untreated
cells
compared
.

We
then
used
expression
microarray
analysis
of
primary
ACC
and
normal
salivary
gland
samples
to
generate
ACC
-
specific
expression
profiling
.

Next
,
we
integrated
the
two
profiles
to
identify
a
subset
of
genes
for
further
validation
of
decreased
methylation
in
the
promoter
region
in
ACC
vs
normals
.

Finally
,
only
genes
that
showed
decreased
methylation
in
ACC
compared
to
normal
were
further
validated
for
mRNA
,
protein
,
and
promoter
methylation
levels
in
a
larger
ACC
cohort
.

Endocrine
therapy
is
the
main
therapeutic
option
for
patients
with
estrogen
receptor
alpha
positive
(
ER+
)
breast
cancer
.

Nevertheless
,
most
of
them
become
estrogen
-
independent
and
relapse
after
the
treatment
.

Ret
is
a
tyrosine
kinase
receptor
that
shows
elevated
expression
levels
in
ER+
human
breast
tumors
.

In
this
study
,
we
demonstrate
that
activation
of
the
Ret
receptor
promotes
proliferation
as
well
as
cell
migration
irrespective
of
endocrine
therapy
.

Microarray
data
show
that
Ret
activation
involves
changes
in
the
expression
of
inflammatory-
and
motility
-
related
genes
.

In
vivo
treatment
with
a
Ret
pathway
inhibitor
in
a
ER+/Ret+
mouse
mammary
cancer
model
,
reduces
tumor
growth
and
lung
metastasis
even
after
endocrine
therapy
.

Additionally
,
we
show
a
connection
between
Ret
and
inflammatory
pathways
.

The
pro
-
inflamatory
cytokine
IL6
lies
at
the
core
of
this
regulation
,
which
involves
a
positive
feedback
loop
with
IL6
and
the
Ret
pathway
reciprocally
stimulating
each
other
to
further
leading
metastasis
risk
.

Our
findings
provide
insight
into
endocrine
resistance
mechanism
and
point
at
the
Ret
pathway
as
a
potential
target
for
future
therapies
.

In
order
to
model
letrozole
-
sensitive
breast
cancer
we
use
aromatase
expressing
MCF7

(

.

Six

day
treatment
(
6
days
)
of
cultures
with
letrozole
(
L
)
or
fulvestrant
(

reversed
the
proliferative
effects
of
the
exposure
to
the
estrogen
(
E2
)
precursor
androstenedione
(
D4A
)
.

The
addition
of
only
EtOH
(
E
)
to
the
cells
was
used
as
control
condition
of
deprivation
.

Treatment
with
the
Ret
ligand
GDNF
(
G
)
partially
rescues
the
inhibition
of
estrogen
-
dependent
proliferation
in
these
cells
.

To
go
deeper
insight
into
the
pathways
involved
,
we
decided
to
perform

The
HER2
(
ERBB2
)
and
MYC
genes
are
commonly
amplified
genes
in
breast
cancer
,
yet
little
is
known
about
their
molecular
and
clinical
interaction
.

Using
a
novel
chimeric
mammary
transgenic
approach
and
in

models
,
we
demonstrate
markedly
increased
self
renewal
and
tumour
propagating
capability
of
cells
transformed
with
Her2
and
c
-
Myc
.

Co
-
expression
of
both
oncogenes
in
cultured
cells
led
to
a
pronounced
activation
of
a
c
-
Myc
transcriptional
signature
and
acquisition
of
a
self
renewing
phenotype
independent
of
an
EMT
programme
or
regulation
of
cancer
stem

markers
.

We
show
that
HER2
and
c
-
MYC
are
frequently
co
-
amplified
in
a
clinical
breast
cancer
cohort
and
that
co
-
amplification
is
strongly
associated
with
aggressive
clinical
behaviour
and
poor
outcome
.

Lastly
,
we
show
that
in
patients
receiving
adjuvant
chemotherapy
(
but
not
targeted
anti
-
HER2
therapy
)
,
MYC
amplification
is
associated
with
a
poor
outcome
in

patients
.

These
findings
demonstrate
the
importance
of
molecular
context
in
oncogenic
transformation
and
acquisition
of
a
malignant
stem

as
determined
by
measurement
of
circulating

,
the
mice
were
treated
with
saline
or
intermittent
PTH
(

)
for
4
weeks
.

At
the
end
of
the
experiment
,
the
human
bones
from
SCID
-
hu
mice
were
snap
frozen
in
liquid
nitrogen
.

RNA
extracted
from
these
bones
was
subjected
to
global
gene
expression
profile
using
Affymetrix
U133
-
Plus
microarray
.

There
are
histological
and
functional
differences
between
human
deciduous
and
permanent
pediodontal
ligament
(
PDL
)
tissues
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
differences
between
these
two
types
of
tissue
at
the
molecular
level
by
comparative
gene
expression
analysis
.

PDL
samples
were
obtained
from
permanent
premolars
(
n=38
)
and
anterior
deciduous
teeth
(
n=31
)
extracted
from
40
healthy
persons
.

Comparative
cDNA
microarrary
analysis
revealed
several
differences
in
gene
expression
between
the
deciduous
and
permanent
PDL
tissues
.

Lacciac
Acid
A
was
indentified
as
an
inhibitor
of
DMNT1
.

MCF-7
cells
were
treated
with
Lacciac
Acid
A
(
200
uM
)
for
5
days
.

Changes
in
gene
expression
were
identified
by
using
Affymetrix
Human
gene
ST1.0
arrays
.

We
used
microarrays
to
determine
global
changes
in
gene
expression
upon
treatment
with
Lacciac
Acid
A
an
inhibitor
of
DMNT1
.

MCF-7
cells
near
mid
passage
were
treated
with
Lacciac
Acid
A
for
5
days
.

RNA
was
extracted
and
hybridized
on
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

Treated
and
untreated
cells
were
from
the
same
cell
passage
.

Two
sample
sets
from
the
same
passage
and
the
third
set
from
the
previous
passage
were
used
.

Cyclin
E1
(
CCNE1
)
is
amplified
in
various
tumor
types
including
high
-
grade
serous
ovarian
cancer
where
it
is
associated
with
poor
clinical
outcome
.

We
have
demonstrate
that
suppression
of
the
Cyclin
E1
partner
kinase
,
CDK2
,
induces
apoptosis
in
a
CCNE1
amplicon
-
dependent
manner
.

Little
is
known
of
mechanisms
of
resistance
to
CDK
inhibitors
.

We
therefore
generated
OVCAR-3
sublines
with
reduced
sensitivity
to
CDK2
inhibitors
and
profiled
by
gene
expression
microarrays
.

Arrayed
samples
included
parental
OVCAR-3
cells
(
n
=
4
replicates
)
and
five
independently
derived
sublines
resistant
to
PHA-533533
(
OVCAR3
-
533533
-
R1
,
-R3
,
-R5
,
-R6
,
-R7
)
.

The
resistant
cell
lines
were
arrayed
after
drug
selection
(
P5
)
and
after
continued
passage
in
the
absence
of
inhibitor
(
P10
+
)
.

This
dataset
was
used
to
benchmark
the
Virtual
Inference
of
Protein
-
activity
by
Regulon
Readout
algorithm
(
VIPER
)
.

Despite
recent
advances
in
molecular
profiling
,
proteome
-
wide
assessment
of
protein
activity
in
individual
samples
remains
a
highly
elusive
target
.

In
stark
contrast
,
protein
activity
quantitation
is
increasingly
critical
to
the
dissection
of
key
regulatory
processes
and
to
the
elucidation
of
biologically
relevant
mechanisms
.

Importantly
,
its
value
extends
to
the
study
of
drug
activity
,
as
most
small
molecules
inhibit
activity
of
their
cognate
protein
substrates
without
affecting
the
protein–≤–Ç
‚Ñ¢
s
or
associated
mRNA–≤–Ç
‚Ñ¢
s
abundance
.

VIPER
leverages
the
increasingly
accurate
and
context
specific
knowledge
of
regulatory
networks
.

Specifically
,
it
uses
the
expression
of
the
transcriptional
targets
most
directly
regulated
by
a
given
protein
in
an
individual
sample
as
a
reporter
for
the
computational
inference
of
its
activity
.

BCL6
knock
down
experiments
were
performed
in
OCI
-
Ly7
and
Pfeiffer
GCB
-
DLBCL
cell
lines
.

Both
cell
lines
were
maintained
in
10
%
FBS
supplemented
IMDM
medium
and
transiently
transfected
with
either
a
BCL6
-
specific
or
a
non
-
target
control
siRNA
oligo
in
triplicate
.

Total
RNA
was
isolated
48h
after
transfection
and
gene
expression
was
profiled
on
H
-
GU133plus2
Affymetrix
gene
chips
.

K
-
RAS
activating
mutations
occur
frequently
in
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
,
leading
to
aberrant
activation
of
Ras
-
MAPK
signaling
pathway
that
contributes
to
the
malignant
phenotype
.

However
,
the
development
of
Ras
-
targeted
therapeutics
remains
challenging
.

Here
,
we
show
that
MED23
,
a
component
of
the
multisubunit
Mediator
complex
that
is
known
to
integrate
signaling
and
gene
activities
,
is
selectively
important
for
Ras
-
active
lung
cancer
.

By
screening
a
large
panel
of
human
lung
cancer
cell
lines
with
or
without
a
Ras
mutation
,
we
found
that
Med23
RNAi
specifically
inhibits
the
proliferation
and
tumorigenicity
of
lung
cancer
cells
with
hyperactive
Ras
activity
.

Med23
-
deficiency
in
fibroblasts
selectively
inhibited
the
oncogenic
transformation
induced
by
Ras
but
not
by
c
-
Myc
.

Transcription
factor
ELK1
,
which
is
phosphorylated
by
MAPK
for
relaying
the
Ras
signaling
to
MED23
,
was
also
required
for
the
Ras
-
driven
oncogenesis
.

Transcriptiome
analysis
revealed
that
MED23
and
ELK1
co
-
regulate
a
common
set
of
target
genes
enriched
in
regulating
cell
cycle
and
proliferation
to
support
the
Ras
-
dependency
.

Furthermore
,
correlated
with
the
strength
of
Ras
signaling
as
indicated
by
the
ELK1
phosphorylation
level
,
MED23
was
up
-
regulated
by
Ras
-
transformation
,
and
was
found
to
be
overexpressed
in
both
Ras
-
mutated
lung
cancer
cell
lines
and
primary
tumor
samples
.

Remarkably
,
lower
Med23
expression
predicts
better
survival
in
Ras
-
active
lung
cancer
patients
and
xenograft
mice
.

Collectively
,
our
findings
demonstrate
a
critical
role
for
MED23
in
enabling
the
'
Ras
-
addiction
'
of
lung
carcinogenesis
,
thus
providing
a
vulnerable
target
for
the
treatment
of
Ras
-
active
lung
cancer
.

To
gain
a
genome
-
wide
understanding
of
how
MED23
and
ELK1
control
gene
expression
in
Ras
-
active
lung
cancer
cells
,
we
performed

We
showed
that
the

Endothelial

many
other

,
physiologically
reside
in
low

relevantly
to

(

)
in

.

 
Such
PCN
is
critical
for
endothelial
functions
.

The
majority
of
our
current
knowledge
regarding
the
cellular
and

mechanisms
governing
endothelial

,
however
,
is
built
on
endothelial

Herein

we
comapred
the

Nonalcoholic

disease
represents
a
spectrum
of
pathology
that
ranges
from
benign
steatosis
to
potentially
-
progressive
steatohepatitis
and
affects
more
than
30
%
of

.

Advanced
NAFLD
is
associated
with
increased
morbidity
and
mortality
from
cirrhosis
,
primary

cancer
,
cardiovascular
disease
and
extrahepatic
cancers
.

Accurate
identification
of
patients
at
risk
for
advanced

is
challenging
.

 
The
aims
of
this
study
were
to
define
the
liver
gene
expression
patterns
that
distinguish
mild
from
advanced
NAFLD
and
to
develop
a
gene

profile
associated

.

We
analyzed
total

from
72
patients
with

and
developed
a

The
characteristics
of
immune
cells
infiltrating
pediatric

is
largely
unexplored
.

A
better
understanding
of
these
characteristics
will
provide
a
foundation
for
development
of
immunotherapy
for
pediatric
brain
tumors
.

Gene
expression
profiles
were
used
to
identify
immune
marker
gene
that
are
differentially
expressed
between
various
brain
tumor
types
.

Gene
expression
profiles
were
generated
from
surgical
tumor
and
normal
brain
samples
(
n=130
)
using
Affymetrix
HG
-
U133plus2
chips
(
Platform
GPL570
)
.

Gene
expression
profiles
of
different
types
of
brain
tumors
and
normal
brain
were
filtered
to
obtain
gene
expression
of
key
immune
cell
markers
.

Comparative
analyses
between
different
brain
tumors
and
normal
brain
was
used
to
identifiy
differential
immune

of
these

The
presence
of
Donor
-
Specific
anti

HLA
Antibodies
(
DSA
)
is
associated
with
an
increased
risk
of
both
acute
and
chronic
antibody
-
mediated
rejection
(
AMR
)
in
kidney
allografts
.

 
AMR
has
remained
challenging
in
kidney
transplantation
and
is
the
major
cause
of
late
allograft
loss
.

However
,
not
all
patients
with
DSA
develop
AMR
,
leading
to
the
question
of
whether
this
represents
accommodation
,
if
other
protective
mechanisms
exist
or
if
this
is
actually
a
state
of
pre
-
rejection
.

Clinical
and
histological
features
,
and
gene
expression
profiles
of
kidney
biopsy
and
blood
samples
of
donor
-
specific
antibody
(
DSA)+
patients
without
rejection
were
compared
to
antibody
-
mediated
rejection
(
AMR
)
patients
to
elucidate
the
mechanisms
involved
in
prevention
of
AMR
.

Of
the
71
DSA+
patients
,
46
had
diagnosis
of
AMR
and
25
did
not
show
rejection
.

50
DSA-
patients
without
rejection
were
used
as
control
.

A
subgroup
of
patients
with
available
biopsy
(
n=61
)
and
blood
samples
(
n=54
)
were
analyzed
by
microarrays
.

 
Both
,
DSA+/AMR+
and
DSA+/AMR-
biopsies
showed
increased
expression
of
gene
transcripts
associated
with
cytotoxic
T
,
natural
killer
cells
,
macrophages
,
interferon
-
gamma
and
rejection
compared
to
DSA-
biopsies
.

Regulatory
T
cell
transcripts
were
up
-
regulated
in
DSA+/AMR+
and
B
cell
transcripts
in
DSA+/AMR-
biopsies
.

Whole
blood
gene
expression
analysis
showed
increased
immune
activity
in
only
DSA+/AMR+
patients
.

There
were
no
differentially
expressed
tolerant
genes
studied
(
n=14
)
in
the
blood
or
biopsy
specimens
of
DSA+/AMR-
patients
.

During
a
median
36
months
follow
-
up
,
4
DSA+/AMR-
patients
developed
AMR
,
12
continued
to
have
DSAs
but
9
lost
DSAs
.

Gene
expression
profiles
did
not
predict
the
development
of
AMR
or
persistence
of
DSAs
.

These
results
indicate
increased
immune
activity
in
DSA+/AMR-
biopsies
despite
lack
of
histologic
findings
of
rejection
.

All
clinically
indicated
kidney
transplant
biopsies
performed
at
our
institution
after
January
2009
were
reviewed
and
263
patients
with
anti
-
HLA
antibody
testing
at
the
time
of
biopsy
were
identified
.

There
were
71
DSA+
and
192
DSA-
patients
(
Figure
1
)
.

Of
the
71
DSA+
patients
,
46
had
biopsy
diagnosis
of
acute
AMR
(
n=9
)
or
chronic
AMR
(
n=37
)
,
and
25
had
normal
histopathology
or
minimal
non

specific
interstitial
fibrosis
/
tubular

(
IFTA
)
.

Of
the
192
DSA-
patients
,
50
patients
with
normal
histology
and/or
mild
non
-
specific
IFTA
were
used
as
a
control
group
.

Clinical
and
histopathological
findings
of
these
3
groups
(
DSA+/AMR+
,
DSA+/AMR-
and
DSA-
)
were
analyzed
.

  
A
subgroup
of
patients
who
were
enrolled
in
the
Institutional

Monitoring
Study–£
who
had
clinically
indicated

(
n=61
)
and
whole

(

)
stored
were
used
for
genomic
analysis
.

Twenty

and

samples
from
DSA+/AMR+
patients
,
13
biopsy
and
14
blood
samples
from
DSA+/AMR-
patients
,
and
20
biopsy
and
12
blood
samples
from

patients
,
 
were
available
for
microarray
analysis
.

Uterine
NK
cells
(
uNK
)
play
a
role
in
the
regulation
of
placentation
but
their
functions
in
non
-
pregnant
endometrium
are
not
understood
.

 
We
have
previously
reported
suppression
of
endometrial
bleeding
and
alteration
of
spiral
artery
morphology
in
women
exposed
to
asoprisnil
,
a
progesterone
receptor
modulator
(
PRM
)
.

 
We
now
compare
global
endometrial
gene
expression
in
asoprisnil
-
treated
versus
control
women
and
demonstrate
a
statistically
significant
reduction
of
genes
in
the
IL-15
pathway
,
known
to
play
a
key
role
in
uNK
development
and
function
.

Suppression
of
IL-15
by
asoprisnil
was
also
observed
at
mRNA
level
(
p<0.05
)
,
and
immunostaining
for
NK
cell
marker
CD56
revealed
a
striking
reduction
of
uNK
in
asoprisnil
-
treated
endometrium
(
p<0.001
)
.

IL-15
levels
in
normal
endometrium
are
progesterone
-
responsive
.

Progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
positive
stromal
cells
transcribe
both
IL-15
and
IL-15RA
.

Thus
,
the
response
of
stromal
cells
to
progesterone
will
be
to
increase
IL-15
trans
-
presentation
to
uNK
,
supporting
their
expansion
and
differentiation
.

In
asoprisnil
-
treated
endometrium
,
there
is
a
marked
down
-
regulation
of
stromal
PR
expression
and
virtual
absence
of
uNK
.

 
These
novel
findings
indicate
that
the
IL-15
pathway
provides
a
missing
link
in
the
complex
interplay
between
endometrial
stromal
cells
,
uNK
and
spiral
arteries
affecting
physiological
and
pathological
endometrial
bleeding
.

39
Samples

We
used
a
mouse
model
of
human
AML
induced
by
the
MLL
-
AF9
fusion
oncogene
,
and
an
epigenetic
shRNA
library
to
screen
for
novel
potential
drug
targets
.

One
of
the
best
candidate
drug
targets
identified
in
these
screens
was
Jmjd1c
.

Depletion
of
Jmjd1c
impairs
growth
and
colony
formation
of
mouse
MLL
-
AF9
cells
in

,
as
well
as
establishment
of
leukemia
after
transplantation
.

Depletion
of
JMJD1C
impairs
expansion
and
colony

of
human
leukemic
cell
lines
,
with
the
strongest
effect
observed
in
the
MLL
-
rearranged
ALL
cell
line
,
SEM
.

In
both
mouse
and
human
leukemic
cells
,
the
growth
defect
upon
JMJD1C
depletion
appears
to
be
primarily
due
to
increased
apoptosis
,
which
implicates
JMJD1C
as
a
potential
therapeutic
target
in
leukemia
.

To
assess
the
effect
of
JMJD1C
depletion
on
transcription
,
we
compared
the
transcriptome
of
shJMJD1C-
and
shScr
-
transduced
SEM
cells
soon
after
induction
of
shRNA

and

as
monitored
by

.

These

were
consistent
across

Deficiencies
in
the
ATM
gene
are
the
underlying
cause
for
ataxia
telangiectasia
,
a
congenital

characterized
by

motor
and
immunological

,
as

as
a

risks
.

MicroRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
are
small
regulators
of
post

transcriptional
gene
expression
and
a
useful
tool
for
cancer
diagnosis
,
staging
,
and
prediction
of
therapeutic
responses
to
clinical
regimens
.

In
particular
,
miRNAs
have
been
used
to
develop
signatures
for
breast
cancer
profiling
.

 
We
are
interested
in
the
consequences
of
ATM
deficiency
on
miRNA
expression
in
breast
epithelial
cells
and
the
potential
contribution
to
cancer
predisposition
.

In
this
study
we
investigate
the
effects
of
ATM
loss
on
the
miRNA
expression
and
related
gene
expression
changes
in
normal
human
mammary
epithelial
cells
(
HME
-
CC
)
.

We
have
identified
81
significantly
differently
expressed
miRNAs
in
the
ATM
-
deficient
HME
-
CCs
using
small
RNA
sequencing
.

Many
of
these
differentially
expressed
miRNAs
have
been
described
and
implicated
in
tumorigenesis
and
proliferation
.

These
changes
include
down
-
regulation
of
tumor
suppressor
miRNAs
,
such
as
hsa
-
miR-29c
and
hsa
-
miR-16
,
as
well
as
the
over
-
expression
of
pro
-
oncogenic
miRNAs
hsa
-
miR-93
and
hsa
-
mir-221
.

All
81
miRNAs
were
combined
with
genome
wide
gene
expression
profiles
to
investigate
possible
targets
of
miRNA
regulation
.

We
identified
messenger
RNA
(
mRNA
)
targets
of
these
miRNAs
that
were
also
significantly
regulated
after
the
depletion
of
ATM
.

Predicted
targets
included
many
genes
implicated
in
cancer
formation
and
progression
,
including
SOCS1
and
the
proto
-
oncogene
MAF
.

Integrated
analysis
of
miRNA
and
mRNA
expression
allows
us
to
build
a
more
complete
understanding
of
the
pathways
and
networks
involved
in
the
breast
cancer
predisposition
observed
in
individuals
deficient
in
ATM
.

This
study
highlights
miRNA
and
predicted
mRNA
target
expression
changes
in
ATM
-
deficient
HME
-
CCs
and
suggests
a
mechanism
for
the
breast
cancer
-
prone
phenotype
seen
in
ATM
deficient
cells
and
patients
.

Additionally
,
this
study
provides
preliminary
data
for
defining
miRNA

that
may
be
used
prognostic
biomarkers
for

.

Recent
identification
of
IL28B
gene
polymorphisms
associated
with
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
clearance
suggests
a
role
for
type
III
interferons
(
IFNs
)
in
hepatitis
C
infection
.

The
function
of
type
III
IFNs
in
intrinsic
antiviral
immunity
is
poorly
understood
.

Here
we
show
that
HCV
infection
of
primary
human
hepatocytes
results
in
a
robust
induction
of
type
III
but
not
type
I
IFNs
,
leading
to
IFN-
stimulated
gene
(
ISG
)
expression
.

In
addition
,
HCV
infection
elicits
a
much
broader
range
of
gene
expression
alterations
in
addition
to
ISG
induction
.

The
induction
of
type
III
IFNs
is
mediated
by
IRF3
and
NFkB-
dependent
pathways
.

Type
III
IFN
,
aside
from
upregulating
ISGs
with
a
different
kinetic
profile
,
induces
a
distinct
set
of
genes
from
type
I
IFN
,
potentially
explaining
the
functional
difference
between
the
two
types
of
IFNs
.

Chimpanzees
undergoing
experimental
HCV
infection
demonstrated
a
prompt
hepatic
induction
of
IL28
,
associating
with
ISG
upregulation
,
but
minimal
type
I
IFN
induction
.

Analysis
of
liver
biopsies
from
HCV
-
infected
patients
supported
a
close
correlation
among
hepatic
expression
of
IL28
and
ISGs
,
but
not
with
type
I
IFNs
.

 
Our
study
demonstrates
that
HCV
infection
results
predominantly
in
type
III
IFN
induction
in
the
liver
and
the
level
of
induction
correlates
with
hepatic
ISG
levels
,
thus
providing
a
mechanistic
explanation
for
the
association
between
IL28
,
ISG
levels
and
recovery
from
HCV
infection
as
well
as
a
potential
therapeutic
strategy
for
the
treatment
of
non

responders
.

Samples
were
treated
with

Aberrant
production
and/or
function
of
multiple
host
systemic

(
e.g.
,
metabolic

)
act
in
concert
to
promote
a

host
milieu
that
directly
promotes
an
aggressive
malignant

as
well
as
drug

.

Hence
,
strategies
with
the
capacity
to
simultaneously
act
across
multiple
host
systemic

may
be
required
to
optimize
therapeutic
outcomes
in

We
hypothesized
that
chronic
aerobic
training
,
a
pleiotropic
whole

body
intervention
,
modulates
multiple
systemic
host
pathways
that
,
in

,
effectively
alters

in

.

Plasma

exposed
to
chronic

were
comprehensively
characterized
for
changes
in
immune

.

Compared

Exposure

exposed

caused
marked
increases

,
compared

.

Only
the
combination
of
cytokines
significantly
reduced
in

following

recapitulated
the

observed
with
patient

in
MCF-7

whereas
only
the
single
addition
of

significantly
increased

.

Co

of

with
patient
exercise
serum
and
a
HGF

increased

Finally

revealed
differential

Our
findings
indicate
the
widespread
potential
of
chronic

to
modulate

Melanocytes

showed
that

correlates
with

We

Human
Polynucleotide
Phosphorylase
(
hPNPaseold-35
)
is
an
evolutionarily
conserved
3–•_5–•
exoribonuclease
implicated
in
the
regulation
of
numerous
physiological
processes
like
maintenance
of
mitochondrial

As

of
the
civil

program
to
define
the
adverse

of
ethanol
on
flying
performance
,
we
present
results
of
our
DNA
microarray
analysis
of
samples
from
a
timecourse
study
of
individuals
given
ethanol
orally
,
and
then
evaluated
by
breathalyzer
to
monitor
blood

(
BAC
)
.

At
five
blood

,
T1

,
blood
was
drawn
such
that
the

,
and
return
to

Microarray

showed
that
changes
in
gene

be
detected
across

.

We
verified
these
expression
changes
by
quantitative
polymerase

(

.

Candidate
target

identified
from
the
microarray
analysis
were
clustered
by
expression

pattern
,
examined
for
shared
functions
and
functional

.

Five

groups
were
revealed
and
functional

showed
shared
transcription

functions
for
members
of
the

These

its

Autosomal
-
recessive
loss
of
the
NSUN2
gene
has
been
recently
identified
as
a
causative
link
to
intellectual
disability
disorders
in
humans
.

NSun2
is
an
RNA
methyltransferase
modifying
cytosine-5
in
transfer
RNAs
(
tRNA
)
.

Whether
NSun2
methylates
additional
RNA
species
is
currently
debated
.

Here
,
we
adapted
the
individual

nucleotide

UV
cross
-
linking
and
immunoprecipitation
method
(
iCLIP
)
to
identify
NSun2
-
mediated
methylation
in
RNA
transcriptome
.

We
confirm
site
-
specific
methylation
in
tRNA
and
identify
messenger
and
non
-
coding
RNAs
as
potential
methylation
targets
for
NSun2
.

Using
RNA
bisulfite
sequencing
we
establish
Vault
non
-
coding
RNAs
as
novel
substrates
for
NSun2
and
identified
six
cytosine-5
methylated
sites
.

Furthermore
,
we
show
that
loss
of
cytosine-5
methylation
in
Vault
RNAs
causes
aberrant
processing
into
argonaute
-
associating
small
RNA
fragments
(
svRNA
)
.

Thus
,
impaired
Vault

may
be
an
important

to
the
etiology
of

Epidemiological
studies
indicate
that
adverse
intrauterine
and
postnatal
environment
has
a
long
-
lasting
role
in
chronic
kidney
disease
(
CKD
)
development
.

Epigenetic
information
can
represent
a
plausible
carrier
for
mediating
this
programming
effect
.

Here
we
demonstrate
that
genome
-
wide
cytosine
methylation
patterns
of
healthy
and
CKD
tubule
samples
obtained
from
patients
show
significant
differences
.

Cytosine

changes
showed
high
concordance
(
98
%
)
with
a
large
(

DMRs
mostly
overlapped
with
putative

regions
and
were
enriched
in
consensus
binding
sequences
for
important
renal

factors
,
indicating
their
importance
in
gene

regulation
.

A
core
set
of
genes
,
including
transforming
growth
factors
and
collagens
,
showed
cytosine
methylation
 
changes
correlating
with
downstream
transcript
levels
.

Our
report
raises
the
possibility
that
epigenetic
dysregulation
plays
a
role
in
CKD
development
via
influencing
core
profibrotic
pathways
.

We
used
microarrays
to
detail
the
differences
of
gene
expression
of
human
tubule
epithelial
cells
between
chronic
kidney
disease
and
normal
.

We
sought
to
decrease
the
cell
type
heterogeneity
of
kidney
tissues
to
increase
the
resolution
of
expression
profiles
.

To
that
end
,
microdissected
human
kidney
tissue
from
both
chronic
kidney
disease
patient
and
normal
are
used
for
RNA
extraction
and
hybridization
on
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

When
adapting
to
environmental
stress
,
cells
attenuate
and
reprogram
their
translational
output
.

 
In
part
,
these
altered
translation
profiles
are
established
through
changes
in
the
interactions
between
RNA
-
binding
proteins
and
mRNAs
.

 
The
Ago2
/
microRNA
machinery
has
been
shown
to
participate
in
stress
-
induced
translational
upregulation
of
a
particular
mRNA
,
CAT-1
;
however
,
a
detailed
,
transcriptome
-
wide
understanding
of
the
involvement
of
Ago2
in
the
process
has
been
lacking
.

 
Here
,
we
profiled
the
overall
changes
in
Ago2
-
mRNA
interactions
upon
arsenite
stress
by
CLIP
-
seq
.

 
Ago2
displayed
a
significant
remodeling
of
its
transcript
occupancy
,
with
the
majority
of
3
`
UTR
and
CDS
sites
exhibiting
stronger
interaction
.

 
Interestingly
,
target
sites
that
were
destined
for
release
from
Ago2
upon
stress
were
depleted
in
miRNA
complementarity
signatures
,
suggesting
an
alternative
mode
of
interaction
.

 
To
compare
the
changes
in
Ago2
binding
patterns
across
transcripts
with
changes
in
their
translational
states
,
we
measured
mRNA
profiles
on
ribosome
/
polysome
gradients
by
RNA
-
seq
.

 
Increased
Ago2
occupancy
correlated
with
stronger
repression
of
translation
for
those
mRNAs
,
as
evidenced
by
a
shift
toward
lighter
gradient
fractions
upon
stress
,
while
release
of
Ago2
was
associated
with
the
limited
number
of
transcripts
that
remained
translated
.

 
Taken
together
,
these
data
point
to
a
role
for
Ago2
and
the
mammalian
microRNAs
in
mediating
the
translational
component
of
the
stress
response
.

In
this
sub
-
series
,
RNAseq
data
from
sucrose
gradient
fractions
with
arsenite
treatment
are
presented
.

We
have
identified
the
overexpression
of
FGF18
as
an
independent
predictive
marker
for
poor
clinical
outcome
in
patients
with
advanced
stage
,
high
-
grade
serous
ovarian
cancer
.

Functional
studies
have
demonstrated
that
FGF18
promotes
migration
,
invasion
and
tumorigenicity
of
ovarian
cancer
cells
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

To
identify
the
FGF18
responsive
genes
contributing
its
biologic
effects
on
ovarian
tumorigenesis
,
we
performed
gene
expression
profiling
in
ovarian
cancer
cell
line
A224
with
ectopic
overexpression
of
FGF18
or
RFP
(
as
control
)
.

Microarrays
were
completed
using
total
genomic
DNA
free
RNA
extracted
from
three
independent
paired
cultures
of
A224
cells
overexpressing
FGF18
or
RFP
.

Microarrays
were
used
to
examine
gene
expression
differences
between
primary
human
hepatocytes
and
hESC
derived
hepatoblast
cultures
treated
or
non
-
treated
with
cAMP
.

hESC
's
were
differentiated
with
a
hepatic
cell
lineage
specific
protocol
that
included
the
use
of
a
3
-
dimensional
cell
aggregation
culturing
technique
.

Followed
by
cAMP
signaling
,
this
promoted
the
maturation
of
hepatoblasts
into
a
more
hepatocyte
-
like
population
.

Importantly
,
key
enzymes
related
to
liver
function
show
that
cAMP
induced
populations
have
a
gene
expression
profile
that
is
similar
to
primary
human
hepatocytes
.

To
elucidate
the
mechanisms
by
which
Nrf2
regulates
cell
growth
,
we
performed
global
gene
expression
profiling
of
A549
lung
cancer
cells
with
knockdown
of
Nrf2
.

Gene
networks
associated
with
carbohydrate
metabolism
and
drug
metabolism
were
significantly
downregulated
in
Nrf2
-
depleted
A549
cells
.

Gene
Set

Analysis
revealed
significant
enrichment
of
genes
associated
with
carbohydrate
catabolic
processes
,
positive
regulation
of
metabolic
processes
,
PPP
,
and
arachidonic
acid
metabolism
.

In
summary
,
this
analysis
revealed
that
Nrf2
positively
regulates
transcription
of
genes
that
play
key
roles
in
central
carbon
metabolism
.

A549
cells
were
transfected
with
non

NS

or

targeting
Nrf2
.

Mock

were
treated

.

We
had

for
each
of
the

.

Ninty
six

were
lysed
and

The
purpose
of
this

was
to
identify

in
human

that
changed

were
transfected
with
the
Rbp1
-
amr
or
slow
(
R729H
-
amr
)
_
-amanitin
resistant
subunit
of
RNA
Pol
II
and
selected
with
_
-amanitin
24
hours
after
transfection
for
additional
24
hours
.

Total
RNA
was
extracted
and
global
changes
in
gene
expression
were
determined
using
microarray
chips
.

MiRNAs
are
transcribed
by
RNA
pol
II
but
the
transcriptional
features
influencing
their
synthesis
are
poorly
defined
.

Here
we
report
that
a
TATA
-
box
in
miRNA
and
a
subset
of
protein
-
coding
genes
is
associated
with
increased
sensitivity
to
a
slow
rate
of
transcription
elongation
.

We
also
show
that
promoters
driven
by
TATA
-
box
or
NF-_B
elicit
high
transcription
re
-
initiation
rate
,
but
paradoxically
lower
levels
of
miRNA
.

Interestingly
,
miRNA
synthesis
was
converted
to
a
more
productive
mode
by
decreasing
initiation
rate
,
but
less
productive
when
the
re
-
initiation
rate
increased
.

This
phenomenon
was
found
to
be
associated
with
a
delay
in
miR-146a
induction
by
NF-_B.
We
also
demonstrate
that
miRNAs
are
remarkably
strong
pause
sites
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
lower
efficiency
of
miRNA
synthesis
directed
by
the
TATA
-
box
or
NF-_B
is
a
consequence
of
frequent
transcription
initiation
that
lead
to
Pol
II
crowding
at
pause
sites
,
thereby
increasing
the
chance
of
collision
and
premature
termination
.

These
findings
highlight
the
importance
of
the
transcription
initiation
mechanism
for
miRNA
synthesis
,
and
have
implications
for
TATA
-
box
promoters
in
general
.

The
effects
of
diverse
stresses
on
promoter
selectivity
and
transcription
regulation
by
the
tumor
suppressor
p53
are
poorly
understood
.

We
have
taken
a
comprehensive
approach
to
characterizing
the
human
p53
network
that
includes
p53
levels
,
binding
,
expression
and
chromatin
changes
under
diverse
stresses
.

Human
osteosarcoma
U2OS
cells
treated
with
anti
-
cancer
drugs
Doxorubicin
or
Nutlin-3
led
to
strikingly
different
p53
gene
binding
patterns
based
on
ChIP
-
seq
experiments
.

While
two
contiguous
RRRCWWGYYY
decamers
is
the
consensus
binding
motif
,
p53
can
bind
a
single
decamer
and
function
in
vivo
.

Although
the
number
of
sites
bound
by
p53
was
6
-
times
greater
for
Nutlin-3
than
Doxorubicin
,
expression
changes
induced
by
Nutlin-3
were
much
less
dramatic
compared
to
Doxorubicin
.

Unexpectedly
,
the
solvent
DMSO
alone
induced
p53
binding
to
many
sites
common
to
Doxorubicin
;
however
,
this
binding
had
no
effect
on
target
gene
expression
.

Together
,
these
data
imply
a
two
-
stage
mechanism
for
p53
transactivation
where
p53
binding
only
constitutes
the
first
stage
.

Furthermore
,
both
p53
binding
and
transactivation
were
associated
with
increased
active
histone
modification
H3K4me3
.

We
discovered
149
putative
new
p53
target
genes
including
several
that
are
relevant
to
tumor
suppression
,
revealing
potential
new
targets
for
cancer
therapy
and
expanding
our
understanding
of
the
p53
regulatory
network
.

Recent
studies
have
suggested
that
deregulated
AKT1
signaling
is
associated
with
schizophrenia
.

We
hypothesized
that
if
this
is
indeed
the
case
,
we
should
observe
both
decreased
AKT1

as
well
as
deregulation
of
AKT1
regulated

in
Peripheral
Blood
Mononuclear

of
schizophrenia
patients
.

We
therefore
examined
PBMC

levels
of
AKT1
in
schizophrenia
 
patients
 
versus
controls
,
and
examined
whether
functional
biological
processes

are
deregulated

observed

The

Molecular
programs
that
mediate
normal
cell
differentiation
are
required
for
oncogenesis

tumor
cell
survival
in
certain
types

cancers
.

How
cell
lineage

genes
specifically
influence
metastatic

is
poorly
defined
.

In
lung
cancers
,
we
uncovered
an
alveolar
cell
-
selective
transcriptional
program
that
preferentially
correlates
with
lung
adenocarcinoma
metastasis
.

This
program
is
required
for
epithelial
specification
in
the
distal
airways
and
is
partially
regulated
by
the
lineage
transcription
factors
GATA6
and

.

These
factors
cooperatively
restrain
the
metastatic
competence
of
adenocarcinoma
cells
,
without
affecting
their
survival
,
through
the
modulation
of
alveologenic
and
invasogenic
 
target

Thus
,
GATA6

are
critical

A
molecular
signataure
of

was
identified
by
comparing
hepatic

.

This
dataset
is
part
of
the
TransQST
collection
.

A
summary
of
the
work
associated
to
these
microarrays
is
the
following
:
 
Background
:
Phenolic
compounds
present
in
coffee
are
antioxidants
in
vitro
that
might
protect
against
cardiovascular
disease
and
certain
types
of
cancer
in
humans
.

Objective
:
Our
aim
was
to
identify
differentially
expressed
genes
upon
incubation
of
HT-29
human
colon
cancer
cells
with
instant
caffeinated
coffee
(
ICC
)
or
caffeic
acid
(
CA
)
using
microarrays
.

Results
:
In
HT-29
cells
incubated
with
ICC
,
77
genes
were
overexpressed
whereas
162
were
underexpressed
.

Upon
incubation
with
CA
,
12
genes
were
overexpressed
whereas
33
were
underexpressed
.

A
list
of
five
overexpressed
genes
and
eleven
underexpressed
genes
were
found
in
common
between
the
two
conditions
and
was
use
to
construct
a
biological
association
network
.

In
the
generated
network
,
STAT5B
and
ATF-2
appeared
as
highly
interconnected
nodes
.

STAT5B
overexpression
was
confirmed
at
the
mRNA
and
protein
levels
.

For
ATF-2
,
the
changes
in
mRNA
levels
were
confirmed
for
both
ICC
and
CA
,
whereas
the
decrease
in
protein
levels
was
only
observed
in
CA
-
treated
cells
.

The
levels
of
cyclin
D1
,
a
target
gene
for
both
STAT5B
and
ATF-2
transcription
factors
,
decreased
dramatically
in
breast
cancer
cells
treated
with
CA
or
ICC
.

Conclusions
:
Coffee
polyphenols
are
able
to
affect
gene
expression
in
cancer
cells
through
the
modulation
of
STA5B
and
ATF-2
transcription
factors
.

The
aim
of
our
study
was
to
evaluate
,
by
using
whole
genome
microarrays
,
the
effects
of
one
cup
of
coffee
,
either
regular
caffeinated
coffee
or
a
coffee
polyphenol
,
such
as
caffeic
acid
,
on
HT-29
gene
expression
,
Three
experimental
approaches
were
conducted
to
assess
the
effects
of
coffee
on
HT29
cells
.

)
.

The
samples
provided
were
analyzed
using
the

revealed
the
additional
effect
of
bevacizumab
,
a
humanized
monoclonal
antibody
against
vascular

factor
(
VEGF)-A
,
to
conventional
chemotherapy
on
survival
of
patients
with
metastatic
colorectal
cancer
.

However
,
a
number
of
preclinical
reports
indicate
resistant
mechanisms
to
anti

angiogenic
therapy
in
several
tumor
models
.

We
investigated
the
 
phenotypic
alterations
of
colorectal
cancer
xenograft
during
antiangiogenic

.

TK-4
,
a
solid

of
nude
mice
and
treated
with
anti

IgG
for
35
days
.

Gene
expression
was
analyzed
using
microarrays
(
Human

)
.

A
specific
set
of
genes
involved
in
regulating

regulated
7
days
after
LVAD
placement
.

6
months
following
LVAD
placement
,
the
expression
levels
of
these
genes
were
significantly
increased
;
yet
importantly
,
remained
significantly
lower
than

.

Calu-3
2B4
cells
were
infected
with
Human

.

 
Samples
were
collected
0

3
,
7
,
12
,
18
and
24
hpi
.

There
are
3
mock
and
3
infected
replicates
for
each
time
point
,
except
for
12
hpi
for
which
there
are
only
2
infected
replicates
(
one
replicate
did
not
pass
RNA

check
)
.

There
were
no
mock
sampes
at
18
hpi
,
and
therefore
infected
samples
at
18
hpi
were
compared
with
mocks
at
24
hpi
.

For
direct
comparison
with
SARS
-
CoV
infected
cells
,
raw
data
from
HCoV
-
EMC
experiments
were
quantile
normalized
together
with
the
SARS

.

In
our
lab
we
detected
focal
genomic
amplification
of
PDE1C
in
90
%
of
short
term
GBM
cultures
.

Knocking
down
of
PDE1C
was
associated
with
compromised
capacity
opf
these
cultures
to
proliferate
,
migrate
and
invade
.

Therefore
we
carried
out
affymetric
whole
genome
expression
analysis
to
identify
the
down
stream
gene
effectors
of
this
function
effects
.

IN1472
and
IN1760

cultures
were
transfected
with
siRNA
either
for
PDE1C
(
siPD
)
or

(
siNT
)
and
its
down
gene
effectors
were
studied
.

IL28B
genotype
was
shown
to
be
associated
with
treatment
outcome
of
antiviral
thearpy
for
HCV
infection
.

We
tried
to
clarify
the
molecular
feature
that
was
associated
with
IL2B
genotype
by
comparing
Hepatic
gene
expression
of
HCV
related
Hepatocellular
carcinoma
and
non
-
cancerous
tissue
with
Il28B
rs8099917
TT
genotype
and
TG
/
GG
genotype
.

We
analyzed
ten
HCC
patients
were
selected
from
each
IL28B
genotype
,
and
their
gene
expression
was
determined
using
Affymetrix
genechip
analysis
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
use
global
gene
expression
analysis
to
determine
major
functional
pathways
and
genes
dysregulated
in
the
skin
of
active
rashes
of
dermatomyositis
patients
.

 
These
data
will
be
used
to
help
assign
a
diagnosis
to
skin
biopsies
from
patients
with
rashes
that
are
not
clearly
dermatomyositis
.

 
In
addition
,
we
will
correlate
gene
expression
changes
with
specific
histopathologic
changes
in
skin
biopsies
that
are
taken
adjacent
to
those
analyzed
for
gene
expression
analysis
.

 
Finally
,
these
data
will
be
used
to
search
for
genes
and
pathways
that
are
associated
with
clinical
outcomes
and
autoantibody
status
in
this
cohort
of

To
identify
molecular
pathological
alterations
in
AD
brains
,
we
performed
interspecies
comparative
microarray
analyses
using
RNAs
prepared
from
postmortem
human
brain
tissues
donated
for
the
Hisayama
study
and
hippocampal
RNAs
from
the
triple
-
transgenic

model
of
AD
(
3xTg

)
Three

,
temporal
cortex
and
hippocampus
with
presence
/
absence
of
AD
and
vascular
dementia
,
and
sex
,
as
factors
revealed
that
the
gene
expression
profile
is
most
significantly
altered
in
the
hippocampi
of
AD
brains
.

Comparative
analyses
of
the
brains
of
AD
patients
and
a
mouse
model
of
AD
showed
that
genes
involved
in
non
-
insulin
dependent
DM
and
obesity
were
significantly
altered
in
both
,
as
were
genes
related
to
psychiatric
disorders
and
Alzheimer–•s
disease
.

We
prepared
RNA
samples
from
the
gray
matter
of
frontal
and
temporal
cortices
and
hippocampi
derived
from
88
postmortem
brains
,
among
which
26
cases
were
pathologically
diagnosed
as
having
AD
or
an
AD

,
and
only
those
results
that
passed
examinations
for

were
retrieved
.

In
total
,
we
obtained
gene

The
mechanisms
underlying
the
progression
of
non
-
alcoholic
steatohepatitis
(
NASH
)
are
not
completely
elucidated
.

In
this
study
we
have
integrated
gene
expression
profiling
of
liver
biopsies
of
NASH
patients
with
translational
studies
in
a
mouse
model
of
steatohepatitis
and
with
pharmacological
interventions
in
isolated
hepatocytes
to
identify
a
novel
mechanism
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
NASH
.

By
using
high
-
density
oligonucleotide
microarray
analysis
we
identified
a
significant
enrichment
of
known
genes
involved
in
the
multi
-
step
catalysis
of
long
chain
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
,
including
delta-5
and
6
desaturases
.

A
combined
inhibitor
of
delta-5
and
delta-6
desaturases
significantly
reduced
intracellular
lipid
accumulation
and
inflammatory
gene
expression
in
isolated
hepatocytes
.

Gas
chromatography
analysis
revealed
impaired
delta-5
desaturase
activity
toward
the
omega-3
pathway
in
livers
from
mice
with
high
-
fat
diet
(
HFD)-induced
NASH
.

Consistently
,
restoration
of
omega-3
index
in
transgenic
fat-1
mice
expressing
an
omega-3
desaturase
,
which
allows
the
endogenous
conversion
of
omega-6
into
omega-3
fatty
acids
,
produced
a
significant
reduction
in
hepatic
insulin
resistance
,
hepatic
steatosis
,
macrophage
infiltration
and
necroinflammatory
liver
injury
,
accompanied
by
attenuated
expression
of
genes
involved
in
inflammation
,
fatty
acid
uptake
and
lipogenesis
.

 
These
results
were
comparable
to
those
obtained
in
a
group
of
mice
receiving
a
HFD
supplemented
with
EPA
/
DHA
.

Of
interest
,
hepatocytes
from
fat-1
mice
or
supplemented
with
EPA
exhibited
synergistic
anti
-
steatotic
and
anti
-
inflammatory
actions
with
the
delta-5/
delta-6
inhibitor
.

Conclusion
:
These
findings
indicate
that
both
endogenous
and
exogenous
restoration
of
the
hepatic
balance
between
omega-6
and
omega-3
fatty
acids
and/or
modulation
of
desaturase
activities
exert
preventive
actions
in
NASH
.

We
discovered
a

Inflammatory
breast
cancer
(
IBC
)
is
a
unique
clinical
entity
characterized
by
rapid
onset
of
erythema
and
swelling
of
the
breast
often
without
an
obvious
breast
mass
.

Many
studies
have
examined
and
compared
gene
expression
between
IBC
and
non

IBC
(
nIBC
)
,
repeatedly
finding
clusters
associated
with
receptor
subtype
,
but
no
consistent
gene
signature
associated
with
IBC
has
been
validated
.

Here
we
examined
microdissected
IBC
tumor
cells
compared
to
microdissected

tumor
cells
matched
based
on

Background
:
With
less
than
a
5
%
survival
rate
pancreatic
adenocarcinoma
(
PDAC
)
is
almost
uniformly
lethal
.

In
order
to
make
a
significant
impact
on
survival
of
patients
with
this
malignancy
,
it
is
necessary
to
diagnose
the
disease
early
,
when
curative
surgery
is
still
possible
.

Detailed
knowledge
of
the
natural
history
of
the
disease
and
molecular
events
leading
to
its
progression
is
therefore
critical
.

Methods
and
Findings
:
We
have
analysed
the
precursor
lesions
,
PanINs
,
from
prophylactic
pancreatectomy
specimens
of
patients
from
four
different
kindreds
with
high
risk
of
familial
pancreatic
cancer
who
were
treated
for
histologically
proven
PanIN-2/3
.

Thus
,
the
material
was
procured
before
pancreatic
cancer
has
developed
,
rather
than
from
PanINs
in
a
tissue
field
that
already
contains
cancer
.

Genome
-
wide
transcriptional
profiling
using
such
unique
specimens
was
performed
.

Bulk
frozen
sections
displaying
the
most
extensive
but
not
microdissected
PanIN-2/3
lesions
were
used
in
order
to
obtain
the
holistic
view
of
both
the
precursor
lesions
and
their
microenvironment
.

A
panel
of
76
commonly
dysregulated
genes
that
underlie
neoplastic
progression
from
normal
pancreas
to
PanINs
and
PDAC
were
identified
.

In
addition
to
shared
genes
some
differences
between
the
PanINs
of
individual
families
as
well
as
between
the
PanINs
and
PDACs
were
also
seen
.

This
was
particularly
pronounced
in
the
stromal
and
immune
responses
.

Conclusions
:
Our
comprehensive
analysis
of
precursor
lesions
without
the
invasive
component
provides
the
definitive
molecular
proof
that
PanIN
lesions
beget
cancer
from
a
molecular
standpoint
.

We
demonstrate
the
need
for
accumulation
of
transcriptomic
changes
during
the
progression
of
PanIN
to
PDAC
,
both
in
the
epithelium
and
in
the
surrounding
stroma
.

An
identified
76
-
gene
signature
of
PDAC
progression
presents
a
rich
candidate
pool
for
the
development
of
early
diagnostic
and/or
surveillance
markers
as
well
as
potential
novel
preventive
/
therapeutic
targets
for
both
familial
and
sporadic
pancreatic
adenocarcinoma
.

Gene
expression
of
13
PanIN
samples
was
compared
to
profiling
data
of
whole
biopsies
from
normal
donor
pancreas
(
N1
to
4
,
two
replicated
samples
)
and
sporadic
PDAC
(
PDAC1
to
6).Ttwo
PDAC
samples
(
PDAC
3
and
4
)
and
a
replicate
of
one
normal
specimen
(
N4
)
were
removed
during
the
hybridisation
quality
assessment
.

Three
master
regulatory
transcription
factors
Pdx1
,
MafA
and
Ngn3
have
the
ability
to
transdifferentiate
pancreatic
acinar
cells
to
insulin
-
producing
beta
cells
in
mice
.

BRD7552
was
identified
as
a
small
-
molecule
inducer
that
can
upregulate
the
expression
of
Pdx1
in
PANC-1
cells
by
high
-
throughput
qPCR
screening
.

We
used
microarrays
to
illustrate
the
mechnism
of
BRD7552
for
PDX1
and
insulin
induction
.

PANC-1
cells
were
treated
with
BRD7552
at
5uM
,
the
mininal
concentration
for
the
maximal
induction
of
Pdx1
.

The
RNA
was
isloated
at
two
time
points
6
-
hour
and
72
-
hour
.

We
evaluated
two
matched
human
cell
lines
derived
from
primary
melanocytes
,
termed
pmel+BRAF(V600E
)
and
pmel+BRAF(V600E)+MITF
.

These
cells
are
therefore
isogenic
with
the
exception
of
the
expression
of
MITF
.

Gene
Set
Enrichment
Analysis
of
microarray
data
identified
a
highly
significant
induction
of
oxidative
phosphorylation
gene
set
in
MITF
expressing
cells
compared
to
control
cells
.

Lymph
node
involvement
is
a
major
prognostic
variable
in
breast
cancer
.

Whether
the
molecular
mechanisms
that
drive
breast
cancer
cells
to
colonize
lymph
nodes
are
shared
with
their
capacity
to
form
distant
metastases
is
yet
to
be
established
.

In
a
transcriptomic
survey
aimed
at
identifying
molecular
factors
associated
with
lymph
node
involvement
of
ductal
breast
cancer
,
we
found
that
luminal
differentiation
,
assessed
by
the
expression
of
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
and/or
progesterone
receptor
(
PR
)
and
GATA3
,
was
only
infrequently
lost
in
node
-
positive
primary
tumors
and
in
matched
lymph
node
metastases
.

The
transcription
factor
GATA3
critically
determines
luminal
lineage
specification
of
mammary
epithelium
and
is
widely
considered
a
tumor
and
metastasis
suppressor
in
breast
cancer
.

Strong
expression
of
GATA3
and
ER
in
a
majority
of
primary
node
-
positive
ductal
breast
cancer
was
corroborated
by
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
and
immunohistochemistry
in
the
initial
sample
set
,
and
by
immunohistochemistry
in
an
additional
set
from
167
patients
diagnosed
of
node
-
negative
and
positive
primary
infiltrating
ductal
breast
cancer
,
including
102
samples
from
loco
-
regional
lymph
node
metastases
matched
to
their
primary
tumors
,
as
well
as
37
distant
metastases
.

These
observations
suggest
that
loss
of
luminal
differentiation
is
not
a
major
factor
driving
the
ability
of
breast
cancer
cells
to
colonize
regional
lymph
nodes
.

The
transcriptomic
study
comprises
16
samples
from
Lymph
node
metastasis
from
infiltrating
ductal
breast
carcinoma
,
18
samples
from
Primary
node
-
positive
infiltrating
ductal,7
samples
from
 
Primary
node
-
negative
infiltrating
ductal
and
3
samples
from
Unaffected
lymph
node
were
included
.

Their
RNA
was
isolated
and
prepared
for
hybridization
to
human
Affymetrix

.

Neural
stem
cells
can
migrate
towards
tumors
of
both
neural
and
non

neural
origins
,
which
is
crucial
for
the
success
in
treating
disseminated
tumors
.

Although
the
understanding
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
NSC
tumor
tropism
is
limited
,
it
has
been
noted
that
several
cytokines
,
growth
factors
and
receptors
direct
the
migration
in
vitro
.

A
proper
understanding
of
the
basic
molecular
mechanisms
of
NSC
migration
towards
tumors
,
especially
identification
of
key
cellular
regulators
of
the
migration
,
will
have
important
implications
in
improving
the
effectiveness
of
engineering
and
employing
NSCs
as
tumor
therapy
agents
.

We
compared
gene
expression
profiles
between
migratory
and
non

migratory
hiPSC
-
NSCs
towards
cancer
cells
using
cDNA

.

We

significantly
altered
the

of
approximately
1900
genes
in
both

.

The
effect
of
SGTA

was
to
suppress
the

of
approximately
60

We
obtained

,
we
characterized

From

,
we
obtained
two

,
one
from
a

and
the
other
from

TIMP-2
is
an
endogenous
angiogenesis
inhibitor
,
i.e.
inhibits
endothelial
cell
proliferation
and
tumor
angiogenesis
.

As
a
result
,
TIMP-2
inhibits
tumor
growth
and
progression
to
metastasis
.

Understanding
,
therefore
,
the
mechanisms
of
TIMP-2
-
mediated
tumor
growth
inhibition
would
provide
further
support
on
the
use
of
TIMP-2
as
a
novel
biological
agent
for
cancer
therapy
.

We
used
microarray
analysis
to
determine
the
TIMP-2
and
Ala+TIMP-2
transcriptional
profiles
of
A549
cancer
cells
in
order
to
understand
how
TIMP-2
inhibits
tumor
growth
and

.

We
overexpressed
TIMP-2
and
its
mutant
(
does
not
inhibit

)
in
A549
human
lung
cancer
cells
and
determined
TIMP-2
and
Ala+TIMP-2
transcriptional
profiles
,
groups
of
genes
and
associated
biological
functions
.

We
then
injected
the
cells
in
NOD

mice
and
RNA
from
tumors
were
isolated
for
further
analysis
to
identify
genes
that
are
associated
with
tumor

.

To
explore
the
psoriasis

,
we
characterize
gene
expression
in
lesional

skin
from

.

We
extracted
total

from
5

taken
from

.

From
each

,
we
obtained
two

,
one
from

and
the
other
from

Rhabdoid
tumors
(
RTs
)
are
aggressive
tumors
of
early
childhood
that
occur
most
often
in
brain
(
AT
/
RTs
)
or
kidney
(
KRTs
)
.

Regardless
of
location
,
they
are
characterized
by
loss
of
functional
SMARCB1
protein
,
a
component
of
the
SWI
/
SNF
chromatin
remodeling
complex
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
genes
and
biological
process
dysregulated
in
common
to
both
AT
/
RTs
and
KRTs
.

Gene
expression
for
AT
/
RTs
was
compared
to
that
of
other
brain
tumors
and
normal
brain
using
microarray
data
from
our
lab
.

Similar
analysis
was
performed
for
KRTs
and
other
kidney
tumors
and
normal
kidney
using
data
from
GEO
.

Dysregulated
genes
common
to
both
analyses
were
analyzed
for
functional
significance
.

Unsupervised
hierarchical
clustering
of
RTs
identified
3
major
subsets
:
2
comprised
of
AT
/
RTs
,
and
1
of
KRTs
.

Compared
to
other
tumors
,
1187
,
663
and
539
genes
were
dysregulated
in
each
subset
,
respectively
.

Only
14
dysregulated
genes
were
common
to
all
3
subsets
.

Compared
to
normal
tissue
,
5209
,
4275
and
2841
genes
were
dysregulated
in
each
subset
,
with
an
overlap
of
610
dysregulated
genes
.

Among
these
genes
,
processes
associated
with
cell
proliferation
,
MYC
activation
,
and
epigenetic
dysregulation
were
common
to
all
3
RT
subsets
.

The
low
overlap
of
dysregulated
genes
in
AT
/
RTs
and
KRTs
suggests
that
factors
in
addition
to
SMARCB1
loss
play
a
role
in
determining
subsequent
gene
expression
.

Drugs
which
target
cell
cycle
or
epigenetic
genes
may
be
useful
in
all
RTs
.

Additionally
,
targeted
therapies
tailored
to
specific
RT
subset
molecular
profiles
should
be
considered
.

.

Data
were
background

and
normalized
using
gcRMA
(
as

.

ANOVA
was
used
to
identify
differentially

,
including

,
 
were
used
to
identify
biological
processes

genes
of
particular
interest
among
the
 
differentially

genes
.

Similar
analysis
of
publicly
available
KRT
and
pediatric
kidney
tumor
 
and
normal
kidney
data
was
also
performed
by
us
.

The
overlaps
between
the
results
were
examined
to
determine
genes
and
processes
dysregulated
in
common
to
both
ATRTs
and
KRTs
.

 
This
study
includes
a
re

Pentavalent
vanadium
compounds
induce
intracellular
changes
in

that
are
consistent
with
those
of

,
promotion
of

While
there
is
no
clear

that
vanadium

,
vanadium
pentoxide
causes

and
in
turn
IARC
has
categorized
it
as

.

The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
carcinogenicity
of
NaVO3
in
the
human
immortalized
bronchial
epithelial
cell
line
,
Beas-2B.
 
Cells
were
treated
with

¬µM
NaVO3
for
5
weeks
,
with

time
,
followed
by
gene

.

In
a
separate
experiment
,
cells
were
exposed
to
1

10
¬µM
NaVO3
for
4
weeks
and
then
grown
in
soft

to
test
for
anchorage

independent
growth
.

A
dose

increase
in
the
number
of

was
observed
.

NaVO3
-
transformed
clones
could
repair
a
wound
faster
than

during
the
scratch

.

In
a
gene

of
soft

clones
there
were
2010
differentially

)
(

0.05
)
in
NaVO3
-
transformed

relative
to

.

DEG
from
this
experiment
were
compared
with
the
DEG
of
5

NaVO3
exposure
with
or
without
recovery
,
all
with

,
and
469

were
altered
in

,
5

treated
cells
,
and
the
recovered
cells
;
a
subset
of
these
changes
were
validated
by
QRT

.

The
data
from
this
study
imply
that
chronic
exposure
to
NaVO3
causes
changes
that
are
consistent
with
cellular
transformation
including
anchorage-
independent
growth
,
enhanced
migration
ability
,
and
gene
expression
changes
that
were
epigenetically
inherited
through
cell
division
.

Beas-2B

cells
is
still
unclear
.

To
reveal
the
genes
expression
regulated
by
H2AX
and
involved
in
apoptosis
,
the
microarray
profiling
analysis
was
employed
to
identify
differentially
expressed
genes
in
H2AX
knockdown
lung
cancer
cells
and
control
ones
after
apoptotic
induction
.

H2AX
was
knockdown
by
miRNA
interfering
system
in
human
lung
cancer
originated
cell
A549
and
the
stable
cell
line
named
P1
,
while
the
control
stable
cell
line
named
C.
Genes
with
greater
than
1.2
-
fold
change
and
P
-
value
_
0.05
were
identified
as
differentially
expressed
genes
between
C
and
P1
cells
both
with
apoptosis
induction
.

The
two
groups
including
control
(
C
)
and
H2AX
knockdown
lung
cancer
cells
(
P1
)
were
harvested
48
h
after
VP-16
treatment
.

Three
independent
experiments
were
performed
for
each
group
.

Background
:
JAG-1
is
a
ligand
of
Notch
signaling
and
can
regulate
cell
differentiation
and
proliferation
in
cancers
.

Recent
studies
indicated
that
JAG1
is
a
gene
associated
with
cancer
progression
.

Therefore
,
we
investigated
the
role
of
JAG1
in
lung
cancer
progression
.

Methods
:
The
expression
of
JAG1
was
manipulated
by
overexpression
or
RNA
silencing
in
several
human
lung
cell
lines
.

The
effect
of
JAG1
on
tumorigenesis
and
invasion
was
assessed
by
the
cell
anchorage
-
independent
growth
,
cell
proliferation
,
cell
migration
and
invasion
assays
in
vitro
as
well
as
metastasis
in
vivo
.

The
potential
downstream
genes
of
JAG1
were
identified
by
oligonucleotide
microarrays
and
quantitative
reverse
transcription–ëVpolymerase
chain
reaction
(
RT
-
PCR
)
.

We
further
measured
JAG1
expression
in
lung
cancer
specimens
by
RT
-
PCR
.

Correlation
between
JAG1
expression
and
overall
survival
of
lung
cancer
patients
was
determined
by
using
the
log
-
rank
test
and
multivariable
Cox
proportional
hazards
regression
analysis
.

All
statistical
tests
were
two
-
sided
.

Results
:
JAG1
enhanced
anchorage
-
independent
growth
,
cell
migration
,
invasion
in
the
lower
invasive
cells
,
CL1
-
0
.

JAG1
also
increased
the
capability
of
migration
and
invasion
in
the
other
two
lung
cancer
cell
lines
(
A549
and
NCI
-
H226
)
.

The
silencing
of
JAG1
inhibited
migration
and
invasion
activities
of
the
higher
invasive
cells
,
CL1
-
5
,
by
siRNA
technology
.

The
invasion
-
promoting
activity
of
JAG1
was
also
demonstrated
in
vivo
by
using
a
mouse
metastasis
model
.

By
microarray
analysis
,
we
found
that
the
expression
of
heat
shock
70kDa
protein
2
(
HSPA2
)
was
activated
by
JAG1
overexpression
and
eliminated
by
JAG1
silencing
.

Moreover
,
lung
cancer
patients
with
high
JAG1
expressing
tumors
had
shorter
overall
survival
than
those
with
low
-
expressing
tumors
.

Conclusion
:
JAG1
might
be
an
oncogene
which
promotes
colonogenesis
and
metastasis
,
and
high
JAG1
expression
is
associated
with
shorten
survival
in
lung
cancer
.

In
this
investigation
,
we
used
a
lung
cancer
invasion
cell
model
to
identify
the
genes
involved
in
cancer
progression
.

JAG1
is
a
potential
oncogene
whose
expression
is
correlated
to
the
survival
of
patients
with
breast
,
prostate
and
liver
cancers
.

However
,
the
role
of
JAG1
in
lung
caner
progression
has
not
been
reported
,
particularly
in
metastasis
.

Here
,
JAG1
was
ectopically
expressed
in
lower
invasive
lung
cancer
cell
line
its
impact
on
colonogenesis
,
migration
and
invasiveness
was
assessed
.

The
underlying
mechanism
was
explored
by
JAG1
-
expressed
transfectants
and
microarrays
and
the
clinical
relevance
was
evaluated
by
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
.

.

Salivary
transcriptomic

discovery
was
performed
on
10
lung

patients
and
10

.

Seven

were
discovered
and
pre

This
study
consisted
of
two
phases
,
including
a
discovery

,
followed
by
a
pre

phase
.

10
lung
cancer
samples
and
10
matched

were
chosen
for
the

phase
.

The
transscriptomic
approach
profiled
the

subjects
using

.

Biomarkers
identified
from
the

study
were
first
verified
using
the
discovery
sample
set
(
10

and
10

)
.

We
recently
reported
an
oncogenomics
-
guided
screening
approach
designed
to
identify
genetic
drivers
of
early

melanoma
metastasis
,
and
in
this
study
we
functionally
validate
the
top

,
homeobox

A1
(
HOXA1
)
,
by
demonstrating
HOXA1–§s
robust
effects
on
melanoma
cell
invasion
,
metastasis
and
tumorigenicity
.

 
Transcriptome
and
pathway
profiling
analyses
of
cells
expressing
HOXA1
reveal
up
-
regulation
of
factors
involved
in
diverse
cytokine
pathways
that
include
the
TGF
_
signaling
axis
,
which
we
further
demonstrate
to
be
required
for
HOXA1
-
mediated
cell
invasion
.

 
Transcriptome
profiling
also
informed
HOXA1–•s
ability
to
potently
down
-
regulate
expression
of
microphthalmia
-
associated
transcription
factor
(
MITF
)
and
other
genes
required
for
melanocyte
differentiation
,
suggesting
a
mechanism
by
which
HOXA1
expression
de
-
differentiates
cells
into
a
pro
-
invasive
precursor
cell
state
concomitant
with
TGF
_
activation
.

 
Our
analysis
of
publicly
available
datasets
indicate
that
the
HOXA1
-
induced
gene
signature
successfully
categorizes
melanoma
specimens
based
on
their
metastatic
potential
and
,
importantly
,
is
capable
of
stratifying
melanoma
patient
risk
for
metastasis
based
on
expression
in
primary
tumors
.

The
HOXA1
-
induced
transcription
analysis
was
conducted
using
RNAs
extracted
from
WM115
cells
transduced
with
either

or
HOXA1
,
followed
by
hybridization
of
labeled

Resveratrol
has
been
reported
to
improve

,
but
has
not

We
conducted

to

in

.

 
Although
resveratrol

was
well

and
increased

without

,
it
did
not

Consistent
with

Altered

In

,
Nuclear

play
a
prominent
role
in
governing
gene
expression
.

NRs
have

.

In

to
understand
the

,
we
treated
MCF7
cells
with
6
nuclear

,
and
performed

NOD2
is
an
intracellular
receptor
for
the
bacterial
cell
wall
component
muramyl
dipeptide
(
MDP
)
and
variants
of
NOD2
are
associated
with
chronic
inflammatory
diseases
of
barrier
organs
e.g.
Crohn
disease
,
asthma
and
atopic
eczema
.

It
is
known
that
activation
of
NOD2
induces
a
variety
of
inflammatory
and
antibacterial
factors
.

The
exact
transcriptomal
signatures
that
define
the
cellular
programs
downstream
of
NOD2
activation
and
the
influence
of
the
Crohn
-
associated
variant
L1007fsinsC
are
yet
to
be
defined
.

 
To
describe
the
MDP
-
induced
activation
program
,
we
analyzed
the
transcriptomal
reactions
of
isogenic
HEK293
cells
expressing
NOD2wt
or
NOD2L1007fsinsC
to
stimulation
with
MDP
.

Importantly
,
a
clear
loss
-
of
-
function
could
be
observed
in
the
cells
carrying
the
Crohn
-
associated
variant
L1007fsinsC
,
while
the
NOD2wt
cells
showed
differential
regulation
of
growth
factors
,
chemokines
and
several
antagonists
of
NF-_B
,
e.g.
TNFAIP3
(
A20
)
and
IER3
.

To
elucidate
the
MDP
-
induced
activation
program
we
generated
isogenic
HEK293
cells
stably
expressing
wildtype
NOD2
or
NOD2L1007fsinsC
using
a
FRT
-
recombinase
based
approach
.

Cells
carrying
the
inserted
vector
cassette
were
used
as
controls
(
mock

)
.

To
comprehensively
analyze
NOD2
-
mediated
innate
immune
responses
we
analyzed
transcriptomal
signature
patterns
using
genome
-
wide
cDNA
microarrays
.

Samples
were
harvested
from
cell
cultures
under

2
h
and
6

The

K
protein
is
a
rare
p53
mutant

.

In
cancer
cells
,
which
express

E285
K
intrinsically
,
endogenous
wild
type
p53
activity
is
reconstituted
by
appropriate

(

)
.

At
non
-
appropriate
cultivation
temperature
(
restrictive
condition
)
this
p53
mutant
is
inactive
.

The
present
study
took
advantage
of
this
mechanism
and
employed
IPH-926
lobular
breast
cancer
cells
and
BT-474
ductal
breast
cancer
cells
,
which
both
harbor
endogenous
ts
-
p53
E285
K
,
for
the
transcriptional
profiling
of
p53
-
responsive
genes
.

This
new
approach
eliminated
the
need
for
genetic
modification
or
cytotoxic
stimulation
to
achive
a
p53
response
in
the
cells
being
investigated
.

Three
subseqent
passages
of
IPH-926
lobular
breast
cancer
cells
(
harboring
ts
-
p53
E285
K
)
were
seeded
into
two
parallel
culture
dishes
each
and
were
allowed
to
adopt
to
restrictive
and
permissive
condition
for
24
h
before
analysis
on
Affymetrix
U133
Plus
2.0
microarrays
.

Subsequently
,
this
experiment
was
repeated
with
BT-474
ductal
breast
cancer
cells
(
also
harboring
ts

)
.

To
gate
out
non

specific
temperature
effects
,
the
same
experiment
was
also
performed
with
MCF-7
breast
cancer
cells
(
harboring

)
.

Probe
sets
differentially
expressed
at
restrictive
versus
permissive
condition
in
MCF-7
were
considered
as
non

.

These
probe
sets
were
excluded
from
the
final
statistical
analysis
of
 
IPH-926
and

We
hypothesized
that

and
that
these

To

for
triple

breast
cancer
(
TNBC
)
,
we
have
employed
whole
genome
microarray
expression
profiling
.

  
We
purified
30
surgically
resected
breast
cancer
tissue
diagnosed
triple
negative
by
means
of
immunohistochemical
staining
and
13
normal
mammary

cells
with
lasermicrobeam

system
(
PALM

)
,
performed
whole

,
and
compared
gene
expression
levels
of
TNBC
,
normal
mammary
ductal
cells
,
and
normal
vital
organs
to
develop
molecular
targets
with
a
minimum
risk
.

Gene
expression
levels
of
30
TNBC
,
13
normal
mammary
ductal
cells
,
and
4
normal
vital
tissues
were
evaluated
.

 
to
clarify
the
molecular
mechanism
involved
in
TNBC
,
we
analyzed
gene
expression
profiles
of
30
TNBC
as
well
as
13
normal
epithelial
ductal
cells
purified
by
laser
microbeam
microdissection
,
and
identified
301
transcripts
that
were
significantly
up

regulated
and
321
transcripts
that
were
significantly
down

in
TNBC
.

In
addition
,
gene

expression
profiles
analysis
of
normal
human
vital
organs
including
heart
,

,
and

allowed
us
to

specific
genes
involved
in
breast
carcinogenesis
such
as
NEK2
,
PBK
,
DTL
,
MELK
and

.

 
Among
them
,
we
focused
on
cell
cycle
regulators
,
asp
(
abnormal

)
homolog
,
microcephaly
associated
(
Drosophila
)
(
ASPM
)
and
centromere
protein
K
(
CENPK
)
as
novel
therapeutic
targets
for
TNBC
.

We
have
generated
tumorigenic
(
S2N
)
and
non

tumorigenic
(
S2
)
,
normal

.

At

both

However
,
at

4
samples
with
3
replicates
each

To
identify
which
miR-148b
targets
were
involved
in
tumorigenesis
,
a
microarray
analysis
was
performed
for
miR-148b
over
-
expressing
cells
versus
controls
and
129
(
49
up
and
80
down
)
modulated
genes
were
revealed
.

The
effects
of
miR-148b
on
cancer
progression
depend
on
the
direct
and
indirect
regulation
of
multiple
target
genes
.

To
identify
miR-148b
modulated
genes
,
MDA
-
MB-231
cells
were
transfected
with
miR-148b
precursors
or
negative

(
pre

miR-148b
or
control
)
and
used
48h
later
for
microarray
and
western

(
WB
)
analyses
.

When
a
–¢Whole
Human
Genome
Oligo
Microarray–£
(
Agilent
)
platform
was
employed
,
129
differentially
expressed
genes
(
49
upregulated
,
80
downmodulated
)
were
found
at
48h
,
considering
a
fold

(
FC
)
cut
of
1.5
and
a
false
discovery
rate
(
FDR
)
of
16
%
(
Table

)
.

Crossing
these
results
with
the
list
of
putative
miR-148b
targets
(
3642
)
obtained
by
the
miRecords
System
,
we
observed
that
33
of
the
modulated
genes
were
also
miR-148b
predicted
targets
and
interestingly
,
26
out
of
these
33
genes
were
downmodulated
.

A
lung
cancer
cell
model
of
invasive
transformation
was
developed
to
select
progressively
invasive
cell
populations
from
a
parental
cell
line
of
human

.

Five

were
selected
using
transwell
and
displayed
increasing

(
Chu

)
.

Here
,
we
used
microarrays
to
analyze
and
compare
gene
expression
profiles
between
CL1
-
0
and
CL1
-

for
the
identification
of

cell
lines
were
used
for
RNA
extraction
and
hybridization
on
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

A
total
of
6
chips
were
used
for
microarray
analysis
including
three
biological
repeats
from
CL1

and
three
biological

.

Twelve
clinical
samples
from
human
esophageal
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(
ESCC
)
(
seven
tumors
and
five
non
-
tumors
)
were
sequenced
using
Illumina
high
-
throughput
sequencing
and
the
RNA
-
Seq
profiling
was
investigated
with
1730
genes
significantly
differentially
expressed
.

The
gene
Rab25
was
found
to
be
down
-
regulated
in
tumors
(
p
-
value
<
1E-20
)
and
identified
as
a
novel
candidate
tumor
suppressor
gene
.

The
down
-
regulation
of
Rab25
was
examined
in
a
large
cohort
of
ESCC
and
non
-
tumor
cases
by
qPCR
and
immunohistochemistry
analyses
.

Aberrant
methylation
in
the
promoter
region
of
Rab25
was
studied
by
demethylation
treatment
with
5
-
aza
-
dC
and
bisulfite
genomic
sequencing
(
BGS
)
.

In
order
to
assess
the
effect
of
Rab25
on
tumor
growth
and
angiogenesis
,
in

and
in
vivo
functional
studies
in
ESCC
cell
lines
using
lentiviral

models
were
also
performed

normal
samples

Purpose
:
The
phosphoinositide
3
-
kinase
(
PI3
K
)
pathway
is
fundamental
for
cell
proliferation
and
survival
and
is
frequently
altered
and
activated
in
neoplasia
,
including
carcinomas
of
the
lung
.

In
this
study
we
investigated
the
potential
of
targeting
the
catalytic
class
IA
PI3
K
isoforms
in
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
SCLC
)
,
which
is
the
most
aggressive
of
all
lung
cancer
types
.

 
Experimental
Design
:
The
expression
of
PI3
K
isoforms
in
patient
specimens
was
analyzed
.

The
effects
on
SCLC
cell
survival
and
downstream
signaling
were
determined
following
PI3
K
isoform
inhibition
by
selective
inhibitors
or
down
-
regulation
by
small
interfering
RNA
.

 
Results
:
Over
-
expression
of
the
PI3
K
isoforms
p110
-alpha
and
p110
-
alpha
was
shown
by
immunohistochemistry
in
primary
SCLC
tissue
samples
.

Targeting
the
PI3
K
p110
-alpha
with
RNA
interference
(
RNAi
)
or
selective
pharmacological
inhibitors
resulted
in
strongly
affected
cell
proliferation
of
SCLC
cells
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
,
while
targeting
p110
-
alph
was
less
effective
.

Inhibition
of
p110
-alpha
also
resulted
in
increased
apoptosis
and
autophagy
,
which
was
accompanied
by
decreased
phosphorylation
of
Akt
and
components
of
the
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
pathway
,
such
as
the
ribosomal
S6
protein
,
and
the
eukaryotic
translation
initiation
factor
4E
-
binding
protein
1
(
4E
-
BP1
)
.

A
DNA
microarray
analysis
revealed
that
p110
-
alpha
inhibition
profoundly
affected
the
balance
of
pro-
and
anti
-
apoptotic
Bcl-2
family
proteins
.

Finally
,
p110
-alpha
inhibition
led
to
impaired
SCLC
tumor
formation
and
vascularization
in
vivo
.

 
Conclusion
:
Together
our
data
demonstrate
the
key
involvement
of
the
PI3
K
isoform
p110
-alpha
in
multiple
tumor
-
promoting
processes
in
SCLC
.

The
liver
has
inherent
regenerative
capacity
via
mitotic
division
of
mature
hepatocytes
.

However
,
if
the
hepatic
loss
is
massive
or
mature
hepatocyte
proliferation
is
impaired
by
chronic
liver
injury
,
HSPC
are
activated
to
support
liver
regeneration
.

Access
to
liver
tissue
from
4
patients
who
underwent
liver
transplantation
for
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV)-
associated
acute
liver
failure
(
ALF
)
provided
us
with
the
opportunity
to
investigate
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
liver
regeneration
in
humans
by
means
of
gene
expression
profiling
and
immunohistochemistry
(
IHC
)
.

Gene
expression
profiling
of
17
liver
specimens
from
the
4
ALF
cases
and
individual
liver
specimens
from
10
liver
donors
documented
a
distinct
gene
signature
for
ALF
.

However
,
unsupervised
multidimensional
scaling
and
hierarchical
clustering
identified
two
-
well
defined
clusters
that
segregated
according
to
the
histopathological
severity
,
i.e.
massive
hepatic
necrosis
(
MHN
;
2
patients
)
and
submassive
hepatic
necrosis
(
SHN
;
2
patients
)
.

We
found
that
ALF
is
characterized
by
a
strong
hepatic
stem
/
progenitor
cell
(
HSPC
)
gene
signature
,
as
also
confirmed
by
IHC
,
along
with
ductular
reaction
,
both
of
which
are
more
prominent
in
MHN
.

Interestingly
,
no
evidence
of
further
lineage
differentiation
was
seen
in
MHN
,
whereas
in
SHN
we
detected
cells
with
hepatocyte
-
like
morphology
.

 
Strikingly
,
ALF
was
associated
with
a
strong
tumorigenesis
gene
signature
.

MHN
had
the
greatest
upregulation
of
cancer
stem
cell
genes
(
EpCAM
,
CK19
and
CK7
)
,
whereas
the
most
upregulated
genes
in
SHN
were
related
to
cellular
growth
and
proliferation
(
AKR1B10
,
NQO1
,
RRM2
,
SFN
,
TOP2A
,
CCNB1
,
CDC20
,
ANLN
and
KI67
)
.

The
extent
of
liver
necrosis
correlated
with
an
overriding
fibrogenesis
gene
signature
,
reflecting
the
wound
healing
process
.

Conclusion
:
 
Our
data
provide
evidence
of
marked
HSPC
cell
activation
and
fibrogenesis
in
HBV
-
associated
ALF
,
which
positively
correlate
with
the
extent
of
liver
necrosis
.

Moreover
,
we
detected
a
strong
tumorigenesis
gene
signature
in
ALF
,
which
underlines
the
relationship
between
liver
regeneration
and
liver
cancer
.

Liver
samples
were
obtained
from
explanted
liver
of
four
patients
with
HBV
-
associated
acute
liver
failure
(
4
-
5
samples
per
liver
)
and
10
individual
normal
liver
donors
and
gene
expression
profiling
was
used
to
establish
a
molecular
definition
of
this
disease
.

This
dataset
is
part
of
the
TransQST
collection
.

To
examine
the
expression
patterns
of
human
miR-22
-
responsive
transcripts
in

receptor
alpha
positive
cell
line
MCF7
,
we
transfected
miR-22
duplex
or
negative
control
RNA
duplex
into
MCF7
cells
.

Gene
expression
patterns
were
then
evaluated
using
Affymetrix
Human
Genome
U133
Plus
2.0
Array
microarrays
.

 
Keywords
:

of

.

Total
RNA
was
collected
from
two
groups
MCF7
-
NC
(
MCF7
cells
transfected
with
negative
control
RNA
duplex
)
and
MCF7
-
miR
(
MCF7
cells
transfected
with
miR-22
duplex
)
and
hybridized
to
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

Each
group
has
three
repeat
samples
.

The
multifunctional
protein
lipopolysaccharide
-
induced
TNFalpha
factor
(
LITAF
)
induces
the
secretion
of
inflammatory
cytokines
in
monocytes
and
regulates
protein
degradation
in
neural
cells
.

In
B
-
cell
lymphomas
,
LITAF
is
frequently
inactivated
by
epigenetic
mechanisms
,
but
beyond
these
data
little
is
known
about
its
regulation
and
function
.

Immunohistochemical
and
gene
expression
profiling
analyses
of
normal
and
malignant
B
-
cells
revealed
that
LITAF
and
BCL6
exhibited
opposite
expression
patterns
.

Accordingly
,
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
and
luciferase
experiments
showed
that
LITAF
is
transcriptionally
repressed
by
BCL6
in
germinal
center
(
GC
)
lymphocytes
and
in
B
-
cell
lymphoma
cells
.

Gain-
and
-
loss
-
of
-
function
assays
demonstrated
that
LITAF
does
not
exert
any
of
its
previous
roles
.

Conversely
,
LITAF
co
-
localized
with
autophagosomes
in
B
-
cells
whereby
activated
autophagic
responses
,
which
were
abrogated
upon
LITAF
silencing
.

Therefore
,
BCL6
-
mediated
transcriptional
repression
of
LITAF
may
contribute
to
an
appropriate
GC
reaction
by
suppressing
autophagy
in
GC
lymphocytes
,
whereas
constitutive
repression
of
autophagic
responses
may
promote
B
-
cell
lymphoma
development
.

Analysis
of

(
DLBCL
)

KARPAS-231
and

with
a

for
LITAF
or

LITAF
expression
vector
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
4
mg

ml
doxycycline
in
the
culture
medium
.

The
over

expression
experiments
were
performed
in

and
the

experiments
in

,
resulting
in
a
total
of
20
microarrays
.

Metastasis
is
a
major
cause
leading
to
mortality
for
lung
cancer
patients
.

We
identified
YWHAZ
as
a
potential
metastasis
-
promoting
candidate
and
found
that
overexpression
of
YWHAZ
promotes
lung
cancer
cell
proliferation
,
anchorage
-
independent
growth
,
migration
,
and
invasion
in
vitro
,
as
well
as
tumorigenesis
and
metastasis
in
vivo
.

It
not
only
increases
cell
protrusions
and
branchings
but
also
induces
epithelial
-
mesenchymal
transition
.

Most
importantly
,
YWHAZ
protein
could
prevent
–à]-catenin
from
ubiquitination
via
its
association
with
–à]-catenin
and
enhance
slug
transcriptional
activity
which
is
regulated
by
–à]-catenin
/
TCF
signaling
pathway
.

Moreover
,
YWHAZ
expression
was
higher
in
tumors
than
in
adjacent
normal
tissues
in
63
Non
-
small
-
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
patients
.

NSCLC
patients
with
high
YWHAZ
expressing
tumors
had
shorter
overall
survival
than
those
with
low
-
expressing
tumors
.

We
conclude
that
YWHAZ
play
a
critical
role
in
promoting
NSCLC
metastasis
.

In
this
investigation
,
we
used
a
lung
cancer
invasion
cell
model
to
identify
the
genes
involved
in
cancer
progression
.

YWHAZ
is
a
potential
oncogene
whose
expression
is
correlated
to
the
survival
of
patients
with
breast
,
prostate
and
liver
cancers
.

However
,
the
role
of
YWHAZ
in
lung
caner
progression
has
not
been
reported
,
particularly
in
metastasis
.

Here
,
YWHAZ
was
ectopically
expressed
in
lower
invasive
lung
cancer
cell
line
its
impact
on
colonogenesis
,
migration
and
invasiveness
was
assessed
.

The
underlying
mechanism
was
explored
by
YWHAZ
-
expressed
transfectants
and
microarrays
and
the
clinical
relevance
was
evaluated
by
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
.

To
explore
the
molecular
mechanisms
and
signal
pathways
induced
by
restoring
tumor
suppressor
gene
HIC-1
on
breast
cancer
cells
.

 
We
have
employed
whole
genome
microarray
expression
profiling
as
a
discovery
platform
to
identify
the
differential
genes
induced
by
HIC-1
gene
activation
.

Small
activating
RNA
(
saRNA
)
that
targeted
promoter
region
was
used
,
and
MCF-7
breast
cancer
cell
line
was
selected
as
cell
model
.

After
96h
for
saRNA
transfection
,
the
cells
were
collected
and
the
whole
genome
expression
profiles
were
analyzed
.

Three
independent
experiments
were
repeated
for
different
groups
.

With
the
treshold
of
 
p<0.01
and
fold
change
>
=
2
or
<
-2
,
there
were
1375
differential
expression
genes
,
which
are
related
to
cell
cycle
,
apoptosis
,
cell
migration
,
cell
invasion
and
cell
proliferation
.

SaRNA
induced
gene
expression
in
human
breast
cancer
cell
MCF-7
was
measured
at
96
hours
after
transfection
by
50
nM
saRNA
.

Three
independent
experiments
were
performed
for
experimental
group
and
control
group
.

Numerous
studies
have
described
the
altered
expression
and
the
causal
role
of
miRNAs
in
human
cancer
.

However
,

to
modulate
miRNA
levels
for
therapeutic
purposes
have
been
challenging
to
implement
.

Here
,
we
find
that
Nucleolin
(
NCL
)
,
a
major
nucleolar
protein
,
post
-
transcriptionally
regulates
the
expression
of
a
specific
subset
of
miRNAs
,
including
miR-21
,
miR-221
,
miR-222
,
and
miR-103
,
causally
involved
in
breast
cancer
initiation
,
progression
and
drug
-
resistance
.

We
also
show
that
NCL
is
commonly
overexpressed
in
human
breast
tumors
,
and
its
expression
correlates
with
that
of
NCL
-
dependent
miRNAs
.

Finally
,
this
study
indicates
that
NCL
-
binding
guanosine
-
rich
aptamers
affect
the
levels
of
NCL
-
dependent
miRNAs
and
their
target
genes
,
reducing
breast
cancer
cell
aggressiveness
,
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

These
findings
illuminate
a
path
to
novel
therapeutic
approaches
based
on
NCL
-
targeting
aptamers
for
the
modulation
of
miRNA
expression
in
the
treatment
of
breast
cancer
.

MCF7
cells
were
treated
with
the
control
drug
or
AS1411
aptamer
.

After
72hours
total
RNA
was
collected
and
analyzed
by
Affymetrix
U133
plus
.

More
than
two
thirds
of
breast
cancers
express
the
estrogen
receptor
(
ER
)
and
depend
on
estrogen
for
growth
and
survival
.

Therapies
targeting
ER
function
including
aromatase
inhibitors
that
block
the
production
of
estrogens
and
ER
antagonists
that
alter
ER
transcriptional
activity
play
a
central
role
in
the
treatment
of
ER+
breast
cancers
of
all
stages
.

In
contrast
to
ER-
breast
cancers
,
which
frequently
harbor
mutations
in
the
p53
tumor
suppressor
,
ER+
breast
cancers
are
predominantly
wild
type
for
p53
.

Despite
harboring
wild
type
p53
,
ER+
breast
cancer
cells
are
resistant
to
chemotherapy
-
induced
apoptosis
in
the
presence
of
estrogen
.

Using
genome
-
wide
approaches
we
have
addressed
the
mechanism
by
which
ER
antagonizes
the
pro
-
apoptotic
function
of
p53
.

Interestingly
both
ER
agonists
such
as
estradiol
and
selective
ER
modulators
(
SERM
)
such
as
tamoxifen
promote
p53
antagonism
.

In
contrast
the
full
ER
antagonist
fulvestrant
blocks
the
ability
of
ER
to
inhibit
p53
-
mediated
cell
death
.

This
suggests
an
improved
strategy
for
the
treatment
of
ER+
breast
cancer
utilizing
antagonists
that
completely
block
ER
action
together
with
drugs
that
activate
p53
-
mediated
cell
death
.

MCF7
cells
were
hormone
-
depleted
for
3
days
and
then
treated
with
10
uM
doxorubicin
for
12
hours

siRNA
-
mediated
inhibition
compared
to
untreated
cells
and
cells
transfected
with
nonsense
siRNA
.

Loss
of
contact
inhibition
and
anchorage
-
independent
growth
are
hallmarks
of
cancer
cells
.

In
this
context
,
frequent
inactivation
of
the
Hippo
pathway
and
subsequent
nuclear
enrichment
of
the
transcriptional
coactivator
yes
-
associated
protein
(
YAP
)
uncouple
cell
proliferation
and
anti
-
apoptosis
from
contact
inhibition
,
associated
with
uncontrolled
tumor
growth
and
tumor
cell
dissemination
.

However
,
general
molecular
mechanisms
of
tumor
-
supporting
YAP
activity
remain
unclear
.

In
this
study
,
we
show
that
overexpression
and
nuclear
accumulation
of
YAP
in
hepatocytes
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
cells
leads
to
an
induction
of
the
Notch
pathways
through
transcriptional
activation
of
the
Notch
ligand
jagged-1
(
Jag-1
)
.

This
induction
of
Jag-1
strictly
depends
on
binding
of
YAP
to
TEAD4
and
does
not
rely
on
WNT/_-catenin
pathway
activity
.

Co
-
activation
of
YAP
,
TEAD4
,
Jag-1
,
and
the
Notch
target
gene
Hes-1
was
significantly
higher
in
HCC
from
patients
with
poor
prognosis
.

High
-
level
expression
and
nuclear
accumulation
of
YAP
correlates
with
Jag-1
/
Notch
activation
not
only
in
human
HCC
tissues
,
but
also
in
colon
and
pancreatic
cancer
tissues
.

Thus
,
our
data
demonstrate
that
YAP
-
driven
co
-
activation
of
the
Jag-1
/
Notch
pathway
in
part
facilitates
oncogenic
properties
of
the
oncogene
YAP
not
only
in
HCC
but
also
in
different
gastrointestinal
malignancies
.

Copper

compounds

,
have
been
presented
as
able
to
promote

thus
being
proper
candidates

.

DNA
fragmentation
and
apoptosis
-in

process
mediated
by
reactive
oxygen
species-
for
a
number
of
tumor

,
have
been
argued
to
be
the
main
mechanisms
.

However
,
a
detailed
functional
mechanism
(

)
is
still
to
be
defined
and
interrogated
for
a
wide
variety
of
cellular

;
before
establishing

.

Microarrays
were
used
to
determine

from

for

played
by

It
is
widely
accepted
that
a
woman–•s
lifetime
risk
of
developing
breast
cancer
at
menopause
is
reduced
by
early
full
term
pregnancy
and
multiparity
.

This
phenomenon
is
associated
with
the
development
and
differentiation
of
the
breast
,
which
ultimately
imprints
a
specific
genomic
profile
in
the
mammary
epithelium
.

In
the
present
work
we
demonstrate
that
this
profile
represents
a
permanent
signature
that
could
be
associated
with
the
breast
cancer
risk
reduction
conferred
by
pregnancy
.

We
have
compared
the
gene
expression
profile
of
normal
breast
biopsies
performed
in
71

(

)
and

We
evaluated
the
trancriptome
of
primary
cutaneous
leisions
caused
by
infection
with
Leishmania
braziliensis
.

mRNA
-
seq
technique
was
used
to
study
the
trancriptome
of
both
host
and
parasite
.

A
total
of
10
samples
was
obtained
from
primary
skin
ulcers
of
two
extreme
clinical
forms
of
American
tegumentary
leishmaniasis
:
(
i
)
individuals
that
after
antimonial
treatment
cured
completely
(
localized
cutaneous
leishmaniasis
-
LCL
,
n=5
)
and
(
ii
)
individuals
that
developed
mucosal
lesions
in
naso
and
oropharynx
areas
long
after
initial
healing
of
the
cutaneous
lesion
(
mucosal
leishmaniasis
-
ML
,
n=5
)
.

 
The
sequencing
generated
an
average
of
13
+
5
million
reads
per
samples
.

The
reads
were
aligned
to
Homo
sapiens
(
USCS
-
hg19
)
and
to
Leishmania
braziliensis
(
Wellcome
Trust
Sanger
Institute
-
V2_29072008
)
genomes
.

Approximately
,
15,000
human
genes
could
be
detected
in
the
samples
.

Low
amount
of
L.
braziliensis
reads
did
not
allow
the
evaluation
of
parasite
gene
expression
.

LCL
and
ML
samples
showed
different
patterns
of
gene
expression
,
indicating
a
more
robust
immune
response
in
LCL
individuals
.

In
summary
,
this
study
demonstrated
that
next
-
generation
sequencing
can
be
used
for
identification
of
potentially
important
biological
pathways
and
drug
targets
in
the
host
-
response
to
L.
braziliensis
infection
and
for
characterization
of
a
gene
expression
signature
that
could
be
used
to
predict
the
disease
outcome
.

Moreover
,
we
also
showed
the
ability
of
this
technique
in
,
simultaneously
,
sequence
host
and
pathogen
mRNA
.

Examination
of
10
fragments
of

5
from

from

patients
.

The
transcriptomic
profiling
of
psoriasis
has
led
to
an
increased
understanding
of
disease
pathogenesis
.

Although
microarray
technologies
have
been
instrumental
in
this
regard
,
it
is
clear
that
these
tools
detect
an
incomplete
set
of
DEGs
.

RNA
-
seq
can
be
used
to
supplement
these
prior
technologies
.

Here
,
the
use
of
RNAseq
methods
substantially
increased
the
number
of
psoriasis
-
related
DEGs
.

Furthermore
,
DEGs
that
were
uniquely
identified
by
RNA
-
seq
,
but
not
in
other
published
microarray
studies
,
further
supported
the
role
of
IL-17
and
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
a
synergy
in
psoriasis
.

Examination
of
one
of
these
factors
at
the
protein
level
confirmed
that
RNA
-
seq
is
a
powerful
tool
that
can
be
used
to
identify
molecular
factors
present
in
psoriasis
lesions
,
and
may
be
useful
in
the
identification
of
therapeutic
targets
that
to
our
knowledge
have
not
been
reported
previously
.

 
Further
studies
are
in
progress
to
determine
the
biological
significance
of
DEGs
uniquely
discovered
by
RNA
-
seq
.

To
define
the
transcriptomic
profile
of
psoriatic
skin
,
three
pairs
of

specimens
were
taken
from
patients
with
untreated
 
moderate

D

cyclins
represent
components
of
cell
cycle
machinery
.

To
test
the
efficacy
of
targeting
D
-
cyclins
in
cancer
treatment
,
we
engineered
mouse
strains
which
allow
acute
and
global
ablation
of
individual
D
-
cyclins
in
a
living
animal
.

Ubiquitous

of
cyclin
D1
or
inhibition
of

associated

activity
in

carcinomas
halted
cancer
progression
and
triggered

,
without
compromising
the

'
health
.

Ablation
of
cyclin
D3
in
mice
bearing
T
-
cell
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemias
(
T
-
ALL
)
triggered
tumorspecific
apoptosis
.

Such
selective
killing
of
leukemic
cells
can
be
also
achieved
by
inhibiting
cyclin
D
associated
kinase
activity
in
mouse
and
human
T
-
ALL
models
.

Hence
,
contrary
to
what
one
might
expect
from
ablation
of
a
cell
cycle
protein
,
acute
shutdown
of
a
D
-
cyclin
leads
not
only
to
cell
cycle
arrest
,
but
it
also
triggers
tumor
cell
senescence
or
apoptosis
,
and
it
affects
different
tumor
types
through
distinct
cellular
mechanisms
.

Inhibiting
cyclin
D
-
activity
represents
a
highly
-
selective
anticancer
strategy
which
specifically
targets
cancer
cells
without
significantly
affecting
normal
tissues
.

or

was
done

A

of

(

)
were
used
for

We
used
microarrays
to
assess
the
changes
in
the
trophoblast

when
PRR15
expression
was
diminished
.

The

,
was
infected
with

Emerging
evidences
indicate
a
new
role
of
TFPI
in
cancer
biology
.

We
recently
reported
that
both
isoforms
of
TFPI
induced
apoptosis
and
inhibited
proliferation
of
cancer
cells
.

The
signaling
pathway(s
)
mediating
the
effects
of
TFPI
is
,
however
,
presently
still
unclear
.

Our
goal
was
to
further
investigate
the
cellular
processes
affected
by
TFPI
and
to
get
insight
into
the
molecular
mechanisms
involved
in
the
effects
of
TFPI
,
using
a
global
gene
expression
study
approach
.

TFPIa
or
TFPIb
cDNA
were
transfected
into
SK
-
BR-3
breast
cancer
cells
for
stable
overexpression
.

Global
mRNA
and
microRNA
(
miRNA
)
expressions
were
measured
and
functional
annotation
of
the
differentially
expressed
genes
and
miRNAs
according
to
gene
ontology
terms
was
conducted
.

Selected
results
were
validated
using
qRT
-
PCR
and
Western
blot
.

Overexpression
of
TFPIa
or
TFPIb
resulted
in
a
6.4-
and
17
-
fold
increase
in
TFPI
protein
levels
,
respectively
.

A
total
of
242
and
801
mRNA
transcripts
and
120
and
46
miRNAs
were
differentially
expressed
in
cells
overexpressing
TFPIa
or
TFPIb
,
respectively
.

Overexpression
of
either
isoform
significantly
affected
the
expression
of
genes
involved
in
cell
development
(
apoptosis
,
cell
movement
,
migration
,
invasion
,
colony
formation
,
growth
,
and
adhesion
)
and
immune
response
.

Network
analyses
revealed
biological
interactions
between
these
genes
and
implied
that
several
of
the
genes
may
be
involved
in
both
processes
.

Functional
cluster
analyses
indicated
altered
activity
of
the
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(
EGFR
)
,
small
GTPases
,
and
the
NFkB
and
JAK
/
STAT
cascades
.

Integrated
mRNA
-
miRNA
analyses
showed
that
up
to
46
and
252
genes
differentially
expressed
in
cells
overexpressing
TFPIa
or
TFPIb
,
respectively
,
may
have
been
regulated
by
miRNAs
.

Overexpression
of
TFPI
in
breast
cancer
cells
affected
the
expression
of
mRNAs
and
miRNAs
involved
in
processes
facilitating
cancer
cell
growth
and
immunologic
response
,
probably
by
signal
transduction
involving
the
EGFR
pathway
.

Total
RNA
was
isolated
from
SK
-
BR-3
breast
cancer
cells
stably
transfected
with
TFPIalpha
or
TFPIbeta
cDNA
,
or
with
an
empty
vector
for
control
.

RNA
was
obtained
from
three
independent
isolations
,
yielding
three
biological
replicates
of
each
of
the
three
samples
.

Mean
expression
data
from
cells
overexpressing
TFPIalpha
or
TFPIbeta
were
compared
to
mean
data
from
cells
transfected
with
an
empty

.

The
loss
of
REST
in
uterine
fibroids
promotes
aberrant

expression
and
enables
mTOR
pathway
activation
We
used
siRNA
to
knockdown
REST/
NRSF
in
cultured
primary
myometrial
smooth
muscle
cells
(
SMCs
)
and
global
gene
expression
was
analyzed
using
microarrays
.

It
has
been
demonstrated
that
Ring
finger
protein
43
(
RNF43
)
is
overexpressed
in
colorectal
cancer
and
mediates
cancer
cell
proliferation
.

We
found
that
RNF43
was
frequently
overexpressed
in
HCC
,
and
knockdown
of
RNF43
could
induce
apoptosis
and
inhibit
proliferation
,
invasion
,
colony
formation
and
xenograft
growth
of
HCC
cells
.

Suggesting
that
RNF43
is
involved
in
tumorigenesis
and
progression
of
HCC
.

We
used
microarrays
to
profile
gene
expression
patterns
before
and
after
RNF43
knockdown
,
and
identified
differentially
expressed
genes
during
this
process
.

HepG2
cells
were
transfected
with
RNF43
siRNA
or
negative
control
siRNA
in

.

Forty

eight
hours
after

the
development
of
drug
resistance
.

The
irreversible
EGFR
kinase
inhibitor
WZ4002
is
effective
against
the
most
common
mechanism
of
drug
resistance
mediated
by
the
EGFR
T790
M
mutation
.

Here
we
show
that
in
multiple
complementary
models
harboring
EGFR
T790
M
,
resistance
to
WZ4002
develops
through
aberrant
activation
of
ERK
signaling
caused
by
either
an
amplification
of
MAPK1
or
by
downregulation
of
negative
regulators
of
ERK
signaling
.

Inhibition
of
MEK
or
ERK
restores
sensitivity
to
WZ4002
,
and
the
combination
of
WZ4002
and
a
MEK
inhibitor
prevents
the
emergence
of
drug
resistance
.

The
WZ4002
resistant
MAPK1
amplified
cells
also
demonstrate
an
increase
both
in
EGFR
internalization
and
a
decrease
in
sensitivity
to
cytotoxic
chemotherapy
compared
to
the
parental
counterparts
.

Our
findings
provide
insights
into
mechanisms
of
drug
resistance
to
EGFR
kinase
inhibitors
and
highlight
rational
combination
therapies
that
should
be
evaluated
in
clinical
trials
.

 
Our
study
identifies
ERK
signaling
as
a
mediator
of
resistance
to
irreversible
pyrimidine
EGFR
inhibitors
in
EGFR
T790M
-
bearing
cancers
.

We
further
provide
a
therapeutic
strategy
to
both
treat
and
prevent
the
emergence
of
this
resistance
mechanism
.

were
exposed
to

methods
.

Individual

confirmed
to

this

For

,

One
of
the
undesirable
side
effects
of
glucocorticoid
use
is
the
potential
development
of
elevated
intraocular
pressure
and
glaucoma
.

The
precise
mechanisms
through
which
steroid
use
induces
ocular
hypertension
are
unclear
.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
identify
gene
expression
changes
induced
by
steroids
in
the
human
trabecular
meshwork
and
the
underlying
sclerocorneal
tissue
.

The
anterior
segment
of
five
pairs
of
adult
human
donor
eyes
were
maintained
in
a
profusion
organ
culture
system
.

Staphylococcus
aureus
produces
the
cyclic
dipeptides
tyrvalin
and
phevalin
(
aureusimine
A
and
B
,
respectively
)
.

A
previous
study
reported
that
S.
aureus
mutants
not
capable
of
producing
these
compounds
were
less
virulent
in
vivo
through
the
deranged
regulation
of
virulence
factor
genes
.

These
findings
,
however
,
have
been
questioned
as
an
unknown
mutation
in
an
operon
that
regulates
virulence
was
discovered
in
the
mutant
strain
.

Here
,
we
report
that
S.
aureus
biofilms
produce
greater
amounts
of
phevalin
than
their
planktonic
counterparts
.

When
administered
to
human
keratinocytes
,
phevalin
had
no
substantial
effect
on
gene
expression
.

Phevalin
had
no
obvious
impact
on
the
extracellular
metabolome
of
S.
aureus
.

However
,
conditioned
medium
from
S.
aureus
spiked
with
phevalin
resulted
in
significant
differences
in
keratinocyte
gene
expression
compared
to
conditioned
medium
alone
.

A
role
for
phevalin
in
manipulating
host
responses
is
apparent
.

Additionally
,
phevalin
is
a
potential
biomarker
and/or
therapeutic
target
for
chronic
,
biofilm
-
based
infections
.

Secreted
factors
from
S.
aureus
biofilm
and
planktonic
cultures
with
equivalent
population
sizes
were
placed
in
contact
with
human
HaCaT
keratinocytes
for
4
hours
.

Keratinocytes
were
grown
to
~90
%
confluency
.

The
apolipoprotein
A
-
I
(
apoA
-
I
)
mimetic
peptide
4F
displays
prominent
anti
-
inflammatory
properties
,
including
the
ability
to
reduce
vascular
macrophage
content
.

 
Macrophages
are
a
heterogenous
group
of
cells
,
represented
by
two
principal
phenotypes
,
the
classically
activated
M1
macrophage
and
an
alternatively
activated
M2
phenotype
.

We
recently
reported
that
4F
favors
the
differentiation
of
human
monocytes
to
an
anti
-
inflammatory
phenotype
similar
to
that
displayed
by
M2
macrophages
.

In
the
current
study
,
microarray
analysis
of
gene
expression
in
monocyte
-
derived
macrophages
(
MDMs
)
was
carried
out
to
identify
inflammatory
pathways
modulated
by
4F
treatment
.

ApoA
-
I
treatment
of
MDMs
served
as
a
control
.

Transcriptional
profiling
revealed
that
4F
and
apoA
-
I
modulated
expression
of
113
and
135
genes
that
regulate
inflammatory
responses
,
respectively
.

Cluster
heat
maps
revealed
that
4F
and
apoA
-
I
induced
similar
changes
in
expression
for
69
common
genes
.

 
Modulation
of
other
gene
products
,
including
STAT1
and
PPARG
,
were
unique
for
4F
treatment
.

Besides
modulating
inflammatory
responses
,
4F
was
found
to
alter
gene
expression
in
cell
-
to
-
cell
signaling
,
cell
growth
/
proliferation
,
lipid
metabolism
and
cardiovascular
system
development
.

These
data
suggest
that
the
protective
effects
of
4F
in
a
number
of
disease
states
may
be
due
to
underlying
changes
in
monocyte
/
macrophage
gene
expression
.

The
EVI1
gene
codes
for
a
transcription
factor
with
important
roles
in
development
and
leukemogenesis
.

Overexpression
of
EVI1
in
acute
myeloid
leukemia
(
AML
)
is
one
of
the
worst
prognostic
factors
in
patients
with
and
without
3q26
rearrangements
.

Evi1
acts
in
several
pathways
through
the
interaction
with
proteins
with
important
functions
in
hematopoiesis
;
however
,
the
role
of
Evi1
as
a
transcription
factor
is
not
well
known
,
and
only
some
Evi1
target
genes
have
been
identified
in
mice
.

Our
aim
was
to
investigate
the
pathways
and
direct
target
genes
of
EVI1
.

Differential
expression
profiles
after
EVI1
knockdown
allowed
us
to
identify
125
genes
involved
in
cell
growth
,
differentiation
and
signal
transduction
that
could
be
related
to
EVI1
.

Moreover
,
we
looked
for
potential
EVI1
binding
sites
within
the
region
1000
bp
upstream
of
the
transcription
start
sites
of
all
human
genes
.

We
selected
a
total
of
70
genes
from
the
bioinformatics
search
,
genes
related
to
EVI1
by
literature
,
and
genes
differentially
expressed
in
the
expression
array
.

ChIP
in
the
TF1
and
HEL
cell
lines
with
two
EVI1
antibodies
demonstrated
that
EVI1
binds
to
the
proximal
promoter
regions
of
18
of
these
genes
,
most
of
them
involved
in
important
differentiation
and
proliferation
pathways
,
confirming
the
important
role
of
EVI1
.

Interestingly
,
EVI1
binds
to
the
proximal
region
of
its
promoter
,
suggesting
that
it
could
be
regulating
its
own
transcription
.

Further
functional
studies
are
in
progress
.

These
data
provide
a
starting
point
for
further
studies
aimed
at
uncovering
the
mechanism

Atopic
dermatitis
(
AD
)
is
a
common
disease
,
with
an
increasing
prevalence
.

The
primary
pathogenesis
of
the
disease
is
still
elusive
,
resulting
in
lack
of
specific
treatments
.

The
prevailing
view
is
that
AD
is
a
biphasic
,
T
-
cell
polarized
disease
,
with
Th2
predominating
acute
AD
,
and
a
switch
to
Th1
characterizing
chronic
disease
.

Identification
of
factors
that
participate
in
onset
of
 
lesions
and
maintenance
of
chronic
lesions
is
critical
for
development
of
targeted
therapeutics
.

We
performed
global
genomic
,
molecular
and
cellular
profiling
of
paired
non
-
lesional
,
acute
,
and
chronic
skin
biopsies
from
ten
AD
patients
.

Onset
of
acute
lesions
is
associated
with
a
striking
increase
in
a
subset
of
terminal
differentiation
proteins
,
specifically
the
IL-22
-
modulated
S100A7
-
9
.

Correspondingly
,
acute
disease
is
associated
with
significant
increases
in
gene
expression
levels
of
the
major
Th22-
(
IL-22
)
and
Th2-
(
IL-4
,
IL-31
)
cytokines
and
Th17
-
regulated
genes
(
CCL20
,
PI3
/
Elafin
)
,
without
significant
changes
in
IL-17
.

A
lesser
induction
of
Th1-
(
IFN
_
,
MX-1
,
CXCL9
-
11
)
associated
genes
was
detected
in
acute
disease
.

Chronic
skin
lesions
are
characterized
by
significantly
intensified
activation
of
Th22
,
Th2
and
Th1
.

Our
data
establish
increased
expression
of
S100A7
-
9
and
other
epidermal
genes
at
onset
of
acute
AD
,
with
parallel
activation
of
Th2
and
Th22
cytokines
.

Our
findings
suggest
an
absence
of
switch
mechanism
in
chronic
disease
and
instead
indicate
that
progression
to
chronic
lesions
is
associated
with
intensified
activation
of
immune
axes
that
initiate
onset
of
acute
lesions
,
particularly
Th22
and
Th2
.

This
alters
the
prevailing
view
of
pathogenesis
,
with
important
therapeutic
implications
.

The
Sin3
histone
deacetylase
(
HDAC
)
complex
is
a
1.2
MDa
chromatin
modifying
complex
that
can
repress
transcription
by
binding
to
gene
promoters
and
deacetylating
histones
.

 
The
Sin3
/
HDAC
complex
can
affect
cell
cycle
progression
through
multiple
mechanisms
and
is
among
the
targets
of
anticancer
drugs
,
called
HDAC
inhibitors
.

 
We
describe
the
identification
of
a
new
subunit
of
the
Sin3
complex
named
family
with
sequence

60
member
A
(
FAM60A
)
.

 
We
show
that
FAM60A
/
Sin3
complexes
normally
suppress
the
epithelial
-

mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
and
cell
migration
.

 
This
occurs
through
transcriptional
repression
of
genes
that
encode
components
of
the
TGF

pathway
.

 
This

reveals
that
FAM60A
and
the

and
extends

Angiogenesis
inhibitors
,
such
as
sunitinib
,
represent
a
promising
strategy
to
improve
glioblastoma
(
GBM
)
tumor
response
.

In
this
study
,
we
used
the
O6
-
methylguanine
methyltransferase
(
MGMT)-negative
GBM
cell
line
U87MG
stably
transfected
with
MGMT
(
U87
/
MGMT
)
to
assess
whether
MGMT
expression
affects
the
response
to
sunitinib
.

We
showed
that
the
addition
of
sunitinib
to
standard
therapy
(
temozolomide
[
TMZ
]
and
radiation
therapy

[
RT
]
)
significantly
improved
the
response
of
MGMT
positive
but
not
of
MGMT
-
negative
cells
.

Gene
expression
profiling
revealed
alterations
in
the
angiogenic
profile
,
as
well
as
differential
expression
of
several
receptor
tyrosine
kinases
targeted
by
sunitinib
.

MGMT
-
positive
cells
displayed
higher
levels
of
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
receptor
1
(
VEGFR-1
)
compared
with
U87
/
EV
cells
,
whereas
they
displayed
decreased
levels
of
VEGFR-2
.

Depleting
MGMT
using
O6
-
benzylguanine
suggested
that
the
expression
of
these
receptors
was
directly
related
to
the
MGMT
status
.

Also
,
we
showed
that
MGMT
expression
was
associated
with
a
dramatic
increase
in
the
soluble
VEGFR-1
/
VEGFA
ratio
,
thereby
suggesting
a
decrease
in
bioactive
VEGFA
and
a
shift
towards
an
antiangiogenic
profile
.

The
reduced
angiogenic
potential
of
MGMT
-
positive
cells
is
supported
by
:
(
i
)
the
decreased
ability
of
their
secreted
factors
to
induce
endothelial
tube
formation
in

and
(
ii
)
their
low
tumorigenicity
in
vivo
compared
with
the
MGMT
-
negative
cells
.

Our
study
is
the
first
to
show
a
direct
link
between
MGMT
expression
and
decreased
angiogenicity
and
tumorigenicity
of
GBM
cells
and
suggests
the
combination
of
sunitinib
and
standard
therapy
as
an
alternative
strategy
for
GBM
patients
with
MGMT

positive
tumors
.

,
we
classified

we

Metastatic
relapse
of
breast
cancer
and
other
tumor
types
usually
occurs
several
years
after
surgical
resection
of
the
primary
tumor
.

Early
dissemination
of
tumor
cells
followed
by
an
extended
period
of
dormancy
is
thought
to
explain
this
prevalent
clinical
behavior
.

By
using
a
gain
-
of
-
function
retroviral
cDNA
screen
in
the
mouse
,
we
found
that
Coco
,
a
secreted
antagonist
of
TGF
-
beta
ligands
,
induces
solitary
mammary
carcinoma
cells
that
have
extravasated
in
the
lung
stroma
to
exit
from
dormancy
.

Mechanistic
studies
demonstrate
that
Coco
awakens
dormant
metastasis
-
initiating
cells
by
blocking
stroma
-
derived
Bone
Morphogenetic
Proteins
.

Inhibition
of
canonical
BMP
signaling
reverses
the
commitment
to
differentiation
of
these
cells
and
enhances
their
self
-
renewal
and
tumor
-
initiation
capacity
.

Expression
of
Coco
induces
a
discrete
gene
expression
signature
strongly
associated
with
metastatic
relapse
to
the
lung
but
not
to
the
bone
or
brain
in
primary
patients–•
samples
.

Accordi
ngly
,
silencing
of
Coco
does
not
inhibit
metastasis
to
the
bone
or
brain
in
mouse
models
.

These
findings
suggest
that
metastasis
-
initiating
cells
require
the
self
-
renewal
capability
typically
associated
with
stem
cells
in
order
to
exit
from
dormancy
and
identify
Coco
as
a
master
regulator
of
this
process
.

Background
 
Accurate
assessment
of
treatment
efficacy
would
facilitate
clinical
trials
of
new
anti

tuberculosis
drugs
.

TB
patients
exhibit
altered
peripheral
immunity
which
reverts
during
successful
treatment
.

We
hypothesised
that
these
changes
could
be
observed
in
whole
blood
transcriptome
profiles
.

 
Methods
 
Ex
vivo
blood
samples
from
27
pulmonary
TB
patients
were
assayed
at
diagnosis
and
during
conventional
treatment
.

RNA
was
processed
and
hybridised
to
Affymetrix
GeneChips
,
to
determine
expression
of
over
47,000
transcripts
.

 
Findings
 
There
were
significant
changes
in
expression
of
over
4,000
genes
during
treatment
.

Rapid
,
large
scale
changes
were
detected
,
with
down

expression
of
~1,000
genes
within
the
first

,
including
inflammatory
markers
such
as
the

.

This
was

expression
of
different
networks
of
genes
,
including
a
later
increase
in
expression
of
B
cell
markers
,
transcription
factors
and
signalling
molecules
.

 
Interpretation
 
The
expression
of
many
genes
is
drastically
altered
during
TB
disease
,
with
components
of
the
humoral
immune
response
being
markedly
affected
.

The
treatment
-
induced
restoration
reflects
the
simultaneous
suppression
and
activation
of
different
immune
responses
in
TB
.

The
rapid
initial
down
-
regulation
of
expression
of
inflammatory
mediators
coincides
with
rapid
killing
of
actively
dividing
bacilli
,
whereas
slower
delayed
changes
occur
as
drugs
act
on
dormant
bacilli
and
as
lung
pathology
resolves
.

Measurement
of
biosignatures
during
clinical
trials
of
new
drugs
could
be
useful
predictors
of
rapid
bactericidal
or
sterilizing
drug
activity
.

Ex
vivo

samples
analysed
for
27
first

and

4

26
weeks

The
pesticide
rotenone
,
a
neurotoxin
that
inhibits
the
mitochondrial
complex
I
,
and
destabilizes
microtubules
(
MT
)
has
been
linked
to
Parkinson
disease
(
PD
)
etiology
and
is
often
used
to
model
this
neurodegenerative
disease
(
ND
)
.

 
Many
of
the
mechanisms
of
action
of
rotenone
are
posited
mechanisms
of
neurodegeneration
;
however
,
they
are
not
fully
understood
.

Therefore
,
the
study
of
rotenone
-
affected
functional
pathways
is
pertinent
to
the
understanding
of
NDs
pathogenesis
.

This
report
describes
the
transcriptome
analysis
of
a
neuroblastoma
(
NB
)
cell
line
chronically
exposed
to
marginally
toxic
and
moderately
toxic
doses
of
rotenone
.

The
results
revealed
a
complex
pleiotropic
response
to
rotenone
that
impacts
a
variety
of
cellular
events
,
including
cell
cycle
,
DNA
damage
response
,
proliferation
,
differentiation
,
senescence
and
cell
death
,
which
could
lead
to
survival
or
neurodegeneration
depending
on
the
dose
and
time
of
exposure
and
cell
phenotype
.

The
response
encompasses
an
array
of
physiological
pathways
,
modulated
by
transcriptional
and
epigenetic
regulatory
networks
,
likely
activated
by
homeostatic
alterations
.

Pathways
that
incorporate
the
contribution
of
MT
destabilization
to
rotenone
toxicity
are
suggested
to
explain
complex
I
-
independent
rotenone
-
induced
alterations
of
metabolism
and
redox
homeostasis
.

The
postulated
mechanisms
involve
the
blockage
of
mitochondrial
voltage
-
dependent
anions
channels
(
VDACs
)
by
tubulin
,
which
coupled
with
other
rotenone
-
induced
organelle
dysfunctions
may
underlie
many
presumed
neurodegeneration
mechanisms
associated
with
pathophysiological
aspects
of
various
NDs
including
PD
,
AD
and
their
variant
forms
.

Thus
,
further
investigation
of
such
pathways
may
help
identify
novel
therapeutic
paths
for
these
NDs
.

its

we
used

to
evaluate
 
under
oxydative

,
 
the
transcriptional
state
 
of
an
epithelial
lung
cell
issued
from
a

and
to
identify
a

of

associated
to

.

the

.

Each

is

.

For
the
oxidative

conditions
,
the
two
cell

are
treated
on

by

.

We
analysed
gene
expression
in
normal
breast
blood

and
breast
invasive

.

Normal
breast
sections
and
IDC

were
immunostained
for
endothelial

.

Vessels
were
dissected
and
captured
with

,
and

was
extracted
and
analysed
on

Certain
oncolytic
viruses
exploit
activated
Ras
signalling
in
order
to
replicate
in
cancer
cells
.

Constitutive
activation
of
the
Ras
/
MEK
pathway
is
known
to
suppress
the
effectiveness
of
the
interferon
(
IFN
)
antiviral
response
,
which
may
contribute
to
Ras
-
dependent
viral
oncolysis
.

Here
,
we
identified
10
human
cancer
cell
lines
(
out
of
16
)
with
increased
sensitivity
to
the
anti
-
viral
effects
of
IFN-
_
after
treatment
with
the
MEK
inhibitor
U0126
,
suggesting
that
the
Ras
/
MEK
pathway
underlies
their
reduced
sensitivity
to
IFN
.

To
determine
how
Ras
/
MEK
suppresses
the
IFN
response
in
these
cells
,
we
used
DNA
microarrays
to
compare
IFN
-
induced
transcription
in
IFN
-
sensitive
SKOV3
cells
,
moderately
resistant
HT1080
cells
,
and
HT1080
cells
treated
with
U0126
.

We
found
that
267
genes
were
induced
by
IFN
in
SKOV3
cells
,
while
only
98
genes
were
induced
in
HT1080
cells
at
the
same
time
point
.

Furthermore
,
the
expression
of
a
distinct
subset
of
IFN
inducible
genes
,
that
included
RIGI
,
GBP2
,
IFIT2
,
BTN3A3
,
MAP2
,
MMP7
and
STAT2
,
was
restored
or
increased
in
HT1080
cells
when
the
cells
were
co
-
treated
with
U0126
and
IFN
.

Bioinformatic
analysis
of
the
biological
processes
represented
by
these
genes
revealed
increased
representation
of
genes
involved
in
the
anti
-
viral
response
,
regulation
of
apoptosis
,
cell
differentiation
and
metabolism
.

Furthermore
,
introduction
of
constitutively
active
Ras
into
IFN
sensitive
SKOV3
cells
reduced
their
IFN
sensitivity
and
ability
to
activate
IFN
-
induced
transcription
.

This
work
demonstrates
for
the
first
time
that
activated
Ras
/
MEK
in
human
cancer
cells
induces
downregulation
of
a
specific
subset
of
IFN
-
inducible
genes
.

Tyrosine
phosphorylation
is
a
hallmark
for
activation
of
Signal
Transducer
and
Activator
of
Transcription
(
STAT
)
proteins
,
but
their
transcriptional
activity
also
depends
on
other
secondary
modifications
.

Type
I
interferons
(
IFNs
)
can
activate
both
the
ISGF3
(
STAT1
:
STAT2
:
IRF9
)
complex
and
STAT3
,
but
with
cell
-
specific
,
selective
triggering
of
only
the
ISGF3
transcriptional
program
.

Following
a
genome
-
wide
RNAi
screen
,
we
identified
the
Sin3a
complex
as
an
important
mediator
of
this
STAT3
transcriptional
repression
.

Sin3a
directly
interacts
with
the
DNA
-
binding
domain
of
STAT3
and
alters
its
acetylation
status
.

SIN3A
silencing
enhances
recruitment
of
STAT3
and
enhanceosome
components
to
the
SOCS3
promoter
,
resulting
in
histone
hyperacetylation
and
enhanced
transcription
.

Conversely
,
Sin3a
is
required
for
ISGF3
-
dependent
gene
transcription
and
for
an
efficient
IFN
-
mediated
antiviral
protection
against
Influenza
A
and
hepatitis
C
viruses
.

The
Sin3a
complex
therefore
acts
as
a
context
-
dependent
STAT1/3
transcriptional
switch
.

MCF7
cells
were
transfected
with
50nM
Renilla
luciferase
(
control
)
or
SIN3A
-
specific
siRNA
.

72h
later
,
cells
were
cultured
for
4h
in

of

and
left
non

stimulated
or
stimulated
with
LIF
(

,

)
.

Total
RNA
was
extracted
.

For
each
of
the
4
conditions
,
3
biological
replicates
were
included
.

Nevertheless
,
one
sample
(
SIN3A_siRNA_LIF1h_rep3
)
was
discarded
.

In
total
11
samples
were
analyzed
.

A

was
conducted
in
which
skin

samples
were

who
were
participating
in

,
an

,

.

This
analysis
identified
4,175
probe

as
being
significantly
modulated
in
psoriasis
lesions
(

)
compared
with
matched
biopsies
of
non

.

Skin

Zinc
finger
nucleases
(
ZFN
)
are
powerful
tools
for
editing
genes
in
cells
.

Here
we
use
ZFNs
to
interrogate
the
biological
function
of
human
ADPGK
,
which
encodes
an
ADP
-
dependent
glucokinase
(
ADPGK
)
,
in
tumour
cell
lines
.

The
hypothesis
tested
is
that
ADPGK
utilises
ADP
to
phosphorylate
glucose
under
conditions
where
ATP
becomes
limiting
,
such
as
hypoxia
.

We
characterised
two
ZFN
knockout
clones
in
each
of
two
tumour
cell
lines
(
H460
and
HCT116
)
.

All
four
lines
had
frameshift
mutations
in
all
alleles
at
the
target
site
in
exon
1
of
ADPGK
,
and
were
ADPGK
-
null
by
immunoblotting
.

 
ADPGK
knockout
had
little
or
no
effect
on
cell
proliferation
,
but
compromised
the
ability
of
H460
cells
to
survive
siRNA
silencing
of
hexokinase-2
under
oxic
conditions
,
with
clonogenic
survival
falling
from
21¬±3
%
for
the
parental
line
to
6.4¬±0.8
%
(
p=0.002
)
and
4.3¬±0.8
%
(
p=0.001
)
for
the
two
knockouts
.

A
similar
increased
sensitivity
to
clonogenic
cell
killing
was
observed
under
anoxia
.

No
such
changes
were
found
when
ADPGK
was
knocked
out
in
HCT116
cells
,
for
which
the
parental
line
was
less
sensitive
than
H460
to
anoxia
and
to
hexokinase-2
silencing
.

While
knockout
of
ADPGK
in
HCT116
cells
caused
few
changes
in
global
gene
expression
,
knockout
of
ADPGK
in
H460
cells
caused
notable
up
-
regulation
of
mRNAs
encoding
cell
adhesion
proteins
.

Surprisingly
,
we
could
discern
no
effect
on
glycolysis
as
measured
by
glucose
consumption
or
lactate
formation
under
oxic
or
anoxic
conditions
,
or
extracellular
acidification
rate
(
Seahorse
XF
analyser
)
under
oxic
conditions
in
a
variety
of
media
.

However
,
oxygen
consumption
rates
were
generally
lower
in
the
ADPGK
knockouts
,
in
some
cases
markedly
so
.

 
Collectively
,
the
results
demonstrate
that
ADPGK
can
contribute
to
tumour
cell
survival
under
conditions
of
high
glycolytic
dependence
,
but
the
phenotype
resulting
from
knockout
of
ADPGK
is
cell
line
dependent
and
appears
to
be
unrelated
to
priming
of
glycolysis
.

we
found
that

)
,

Mechanistically

by
serving
as

To
investigate
unbiasedly

is
a

,
we
compared
the
transcriptomic
profile
of
cells
either
overexpressing

.

We
collected

cALL
)
is
the
most
frequent
entity
of
childhood
ALL
and
carries
an

enabled
the
identification
of
aberrantly

in
malignant

,
facilitating
discrimination
of

and
possibly
revealing

clearly
distinguished

revealed
487

A
comparison
to

revealed
465

Background
:
In
the
last
decade
,
much
attention
has
been
drawn
to
probiotic
bacteria
in
the
context
of
inflammatory
bowel
disease
(
IBD
)
,
since
the
potential
of
certain
strains
to
attenuate
inflammation
was
demonstrated
in
several
animal
experiments
and
clinical
studies
.

Data
in
humans
elucidating
the
molecular
mechanism
of
probiotic
action
are
still
scarce
.

To
this
end
,
we
used
an
organ
culture
system
of
human
colon
mucosa
and
investigated
the
gene
expression
profiles
after
treatment
with
different
probiotic
bacteria
in
phorbol
12
-
myristate
13
-
acetate
(
PMA)/ionomycin
(
IO
)
)
stimulated
samples
using
whole
genome
microarrays
.

Moreover
,
we
analyzed
changes
occurring
in
the
intestinal
explants
cultured
for
8
hours
when
compared
to
fresh
,
directly
frozen
mucosa
,
in
order
to
infer
the
suitability
of
the
system
to
study
an
inflammatory
stimulus
and
likely
antiinflammatory
responses
.

Results
:
Culturing
intestinal
colon
fragments
during
8
hours
elicited
differential
gene
expression
in
283
genes
,
229
upregulated
and
54
downregulated
.

Upregulated
genes
were
predominantly
related
to
apoptosis
,
whereas
downregulated
genes
encoded
mitochondrial
proteins
.

No
specific
enrichment
of
genes
related
to
inflammation
or
immune
response
could
be
detected
,
confirming
the
suitability
of
the
system
to
further
study
the
inmunomodulatory
/
anti
-
inflammatory
properties
of
Lactobacillus
casei
BL23
(
BL23
)
,
L.plantarum
299v
(
LP299v
)
and
L.plantarum
299v
(
A-
)
(
LP299v
(
A-
)
)
,
a
mutant
strain
with
reduced
adhesive
properties
to
enterocytes
.

Intestinal
explants
were
stimulated
with
PMA
/
IO
for
3
hours
and
subsequently
incubated
with
probiotic
bacteria
for
4
h.
ANOVA
analysis
(
p
–Ü

)
revealed
205
differentially
expressed
genes
between
Control
,
PMA
/
IO
(
Inflamed
)
,
and
the
3
bacterial
treatments
.

Most
importantly
,
a
number
of
PMA
/
IO
induced
genes
related
to
immune
response
and
immune
system
process
such
as
IL-2
,
IFN-
_
,
IL17A
and
pro
-
inflammatory
cytokines
CXCL9
and
CXCL11
were
downregulated
by
BL23
,
LP299v
and
LP299v
(
A-
)
.

The
behaviour
of
the
three
Lactobacillus
strains
was
quite
similar
,
although
their
presence
induced
differential
expression
of
a
small
number
of
genes
in
a
strain
dependent
manner
.

Conclusion
:
The
human
colon
organ
culture
was
found
to
be
a
suitable
model
for
the
study
of
inflammatory
/
anti
-
inflammatory
stimuli
,
and
therefore
it
constitutes
a
valuable
tool
to
determine
the
inmunomodulatory
effect
of
probiotic
bacteria
.

The
global
transcriptional
profile
evoked
by
strains
BL23
,
LP299v
and
LP299v
(
A-
)
in
artificially
inflamed
tissue
indicated
a
clear
homeostasis
restoring
effect
,
including
a
decrease
of
the
signals
produced
by
activated
T
cells
.

Macroscopically
healthy
colonic
intestinal
tissue
was
obtained
at
surgery
from
3
patients
.

Intestinal
explants
were
treated
with
PMA
and
ionomycin
for
3
h
to
induce
pro
-
inflammatory
conditions
.

Then
,
culture
medium
was
changed
and
replaced
with
either
medium
or
medium
containing
either
Lactobacillus
casei
BL23
,
Lactobacillus
plantarum
299v
,
or
a
nonadherent
mutant
of
L.
plantarum
299v
(
A-
)
and
incubated
for
further
4
hours
.

In
parallel
,
control
intestinal
explants
were
cultured
without
any
treatment
of
PMA
/
ionomycin
or
probiotic
bacteria
and
compared
to
directly
frozen
tissue
in
order
to
evaluate
changes
in
gene
expression
which
are
due
solely
to
the
culture
conditions
.

We
aimed
at
identifying
lymphangiogenic
subpopulations
by
comparative
analysis
of
single
cell
clones
derived
from
a
melanoma
of
a
single
patient
.

Selected
clones
were
grafted
into
SCID
mice
,
where
they
induced
lymphangiogenesis
and
metastasized
into
sentinel
nodes
,
whereas
non
-
lymphangiogenic
clones
from
the
same
patient
did
not
metastasize
.

RNA
isolated
from
primary
SCID
mouse
tumors
were
used
for
transcriptome
analysis
.

Many
cytokines
are
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
autoimmune
diseases
and
are
recognized
as
relevant
therapeutic
targets
to
attenuate
inflammation
,
such
as
TNF
_
in
RA
and
IFN_/
_
in
SLE
.

To
relate
the
transcriptional
imprinting
of
cytokines
in
a
cell
type
-
specific
and
disease
-
specific
manner
,
we
generated
gene
-
expression
profiles
from
peripheral
monocytes
of
SLE
and
RA
patients
and
compared
them
to
in
vitro
-
generated
signatures
induced
by
TNF
_
,
IFN_2a
and
IFN
_
.

Monocytes
from
SLE
and
RA
patients
revealed
disease
-
specific
gene
-
expression
profiles
.

In
vitro
-
generated
signatures
induced
by
IFN_2a
and
IFN
_
showed
similar
profiles
that
only
partially
overlapped
with
those
induced
by
TNF
_
.

Comparisons
between
disease
-
specific
and
in
vitro
-
generated
signatures
identified
cytokine
-
regulated
genes
in
SLE
and
RA
with
qualitative
and
quantitative
differences
.

The
IFN
-
responses
in
SLE
and
RA
were
found
to
be
regulated
in
a
STAT1
-
dependent
and
STAT1
-
independent
manner
,
respectively
.

Similarly
,
genes
recognized
as
TNF_-regulated
were
clearly
distinguishable
between
RA
and
SLE
patients
.

While
the
activity
of
SLE
monocytes
was
mainly
driven
by
IFN
,
the
activity
from
RA
monocytes
showed
a
dominance
of
TNF
_
that
was
characterized
by
STAT1
down
-
regulation
.

The
responses
to
specific
cytokines
were
revealed
to
be
disease
-
dependent
and
reflected
the
interplay
of
cytokines
within
various
inflammatory
milieus
.

This
study
has
demonstrated
that
monocytes
from
RA
and
SLE
patients
exhibit
disease
-
specific
gene
-
expression
profiles
,
which
can
be
molecularly
dissected
when
compared
to
in
vitro
-
generated
cytokine
signatures
.

The
results
suggest
that
an
assessment
of
cytokine
-
response
status
in
monocytes
may
be
helpful
for
improvement
of
diagnosis
and
selection
of
the
best
cytokine
target
for
therapeutic
intervention
.

and

.

Monocytes
from
patients
with
SLE
and
RA
and
from
healthy
donors
were
used
for
generating
disease
-
specific
gene
-
expression
profiles
,
where
these
profiles
represent
in

activation
of
monocytes
.

In
addition
,
monocytes
from
healthy
donors
were
stimulated
in
vitro
by
cytokines
:
TNF
_
,
IFN_2a
and
IFN
_
.

Cytokine
-
specific
gene
-
expression
profiles
were
generated
by
comparing
stimulated
monocytes
with
unstimulated
ones
.

TNF_-
,

Epithelial
-
mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
is
an
important
mechanism
in
carcinogenesis
.

To
determine
the
mechanisms
that
are
involved
in
the
regulation
of
EMT
is
crucial
to
develop
new
biomarkers
and
therapeutic
targets
towards
cancers
.

In
this
study
,
when
TGF¬ß1
and
TNFa
were
used
to
induce
EMT
in
human
lung
carcinoma
A549
cells
,
we
were
surprised
to
find
an
increase
in
an
epithelial
cell
tight
junction
marker
,
Claudin
1
.

We
further
identified
that
it
was
the
TNFa
and
not
the
TGF¬ß1
that
induced
the
fibroblast
-
like
morphology
changes
.

TNFa
also
caused
the
increase
in
Claudin-1
gene
expression
and
protein
levels
in
Triton
X-100
soluble
cytoplasm
fraction
.

Down
-
regulation
of
Claudin-1
,
using
small
interfering
RNA
(
siRNA
)
,
inhibited
75
%
of
TNFa
-
induced
gene
expression
changes
.

Claudin-1
siRNA
effectively
blocked
TNFa
-
induced
molecular
functional
networks
related
to
inflammation
and
cell
movement
.

Wound
-
healing
assay
showed
that
Claudin-1
siRNA
was
able
to
significantly
reduce
TNF
-
enhanced
cell
migration
.

Furthermore
,
over
expression
of
Claudin
1
with
a
Claudin
1
-
pcDNA3.1
/
V5
-
His
vector
enhanced
cell
migration
.

In
conclusion
,
these
observations
indicate
that
Claudin
1
acts
as
a
critical
signal
mediator
in
TNFa
-
induced
gene
expression
and
cell
migration
in
human
lung
cancer
cells
.

Further
analyses
of
these
cellular
processes
may
be
helpful
in
developing
novel
therapeutic
strategies
.

We
demonstrate
that
the

reprograms
the

is

We
aimed
to
analyze
the
effects
of
Wnt-1
overexpression
on
the

correlated
the

Glioblastoma
multiforme
(

)
is
the
most
malignant
and
most
common
tumor
of
the
central
nervous
system
characterized
by
rapid
growth
and
extensive
tissue
infiltration
.

GBM
results
in
more
years
of
life
lost
than
any
other
cancer
type
.

Notch
signaling
has
been
implicated
in
GBM
pathogenesis
through
several
modes
of
action
.

Inhibition
of
Notch
leads
to
a
reduction
of
cancer
-
initiating
cells
in
gliomas
and
reduces
proliferation
and
migration
.

Deltex1
(
DTX1
)
is
part
of
an
alternative
Notch
signaling
pathway
distinct
from
the
canonical
MAML1
/
RBPJ–û—î
-
mediated
cascade
.

In
this
study
,
we
show
that
DTX1
activates
both
the
RTK
/
PI3K
/
PKB
as
well
as
the
MAPK
/
ERK
pathway
.

Moreover
,
we
found
the
anti
-
apoptotic
factor
Mcl-1
to
be
induced
by
DTX1
.

In
accordance
with
this
,
the
clonogenic
potential
and
proliferation
rates
of
glioma
cell
lines
correlated
with
DTX1
levels
.

DTX1
knock
down
mitigated
the
tumorigenic
potential
in
vivo
,
and
overexpression
of
DTX1
increased
cell
migration
and
invasion
of
tumor
cells
accompanied
by
an
elevation
of
the
pro
-
migratory
factors
PKB–û–Ü
and
Snail1
.

Microarray

analysis
identified
a
DTX1
-
specific
transcriptional
program
-
including
microRNA-21
-
which
is
distinct
from
the
canonical
Notch
signaling
.

We
propose
the
alternative
Notch
pathway
via
DTX1
as
oncogenic
factor
in
malignant
glioma
and
found
low
DTX1
expression
levels
to
correlate
with
prolonged
survival
of
GBM
and

Crosstalk
and
complexity
within
signaling
pathways
has
limited
our
ability
to
devise
rational
strategies
for
using
network
biology
to
treat
human
disease
.

This
is
particularly
problematic
in
cancer
where
oncogenes
that
drive
or
maintain
the
tumorigenic
state
alter
the
normal
flow
of
molecular
information
within
signaling
networks
that
control
growth
,
survival
and

.

Understanding
the
architecture
of
oncogenic
signaling
pathways
,
and
how
these
networks
are
re

wired
by
ligands
or

,
could
provide
opportunities
for
the

of

ISWI
is
an
evolutionary
conserved
ATPase
that
catalyzes
nucleosome
remodeling
in
several
different
complexes
.

Two
mammalian
ISWI
orthologs
,
SNF2H
and
SNF2L
,
have
specialized
functions
despite
their
high
similarity
.

Due
to
the
lack
of
reagents
the
functions
of
SN2L
in
human
cells
had
not
been
established
.

Newly
established
specific
monoclonal

and
selective
RNA
interference
protocols
now
enabled
a
comprehensive
characterization
of
loss

of
-
function
phenotypes
in
human
cells
.

 
Contrasting
earlier
results
obtained
in
the
mouse
model
,
we
found
SNF2L
broadly
expressed
in
primary
human
tissues
.

Depletion
of
SNF2L
in
HeLa
cells
led
to
enhanced
proliferation
,
morphological
alterations
and
increased
migration
.

These
phenomena
were
explained
by
transcriptome
profiling
,
which
identified
SNF2L
as
a
modulator
of
the
Wnt
signaling
network
.

The
cumulative
effects
of
SNF2L
depletion
on
gene
expression
portray
the
cell
in
a
state
of
activated
Wnt
signaling
characterized
by
increased
proliferation
and
chemotactic
locomotion
.

High
levels
of
SNF2L
expression
in

to
undetectable

in

.

In
summary
,
our
data
document
an
anti
-
correlation
between
SNF2L
expression
and
several
features
characteristic
of
malignant
cells
.

Alternative
splicing
results
in
the
production
of
several
different
isoforms
of
VEGF
.

We
have
previously
generated
human
breast
cancer
cells
overexpressing
VEGF165
or
VEGF189
isoforms
(
referred
to
as
the
V165
and
V189
clones
,
respectively
)
and
showed
that
VEGF189
-
transfected
cells
were
less
tumorigenic
.

In
this
study
,
we
used
bioluminescence
imaging
to
analyze
the
metastasis
capacity
of
breast
cancer
cell
lines
(
MDA
-
MB-321
)
overexpressing
VEGF
isoforms
in
nude
mice
.

V165
,
V189
and
control
cV
clones
were
transfected
with
a
luciferase
plasmid
to
generate
bioluminescent
clones
(
the
V165
-
B
,
V189
-
B
and
cV
clones
,
respectively
)
.

These
clones
were
then
injected
into
the
left
heart
ventricle
of
nude
mice
.

Analysis
of
the
location
of
metastases
shows
that
V189
-
B
cells
induced
fewer
metastases
in
lung
and
bone
than
V165
-
B
and
cV
-
B
cells
.

Moreover
,
there
was
a
delay
on
metastasis
appearance
in
mice
receiving
VEGF
V189
-
B
clone
,
consistent
with
increase
survival
in
these
mice
.

We
investigated
the
possible
mechanisms
underlying
these
effects
and
found
that
VEGF189
increased
adhesion
and
decreased
cell
invasion
and
survival
in
vitro
.

In
the
other
side
,
transcriptomic
analyses
shown
expression
of
genes
,
implicated
in
breast
cancer
and
metastatic
dissemination
,
in
VEGF165
overexpressing
cells
.

After
in
silico
analyses
of
genes
differentially
expressed
between
V189
and
V165
cells
,
we
used
Q
-
PCR
assays
to
quantify
mRNA
levels
of
some
gene
of
interest
 
in
120
breast
tumors
from
patients
with
or
without
metastasis
and/or
specially
lung
metastasis
.

 
We
found
that
genes
have
prognostical
significance
and
/or
showed
an
influence
on
relapse
-
free
survival
.

These
data
provide
the
first
evidence
that
different
VEGF
isoforms
have
different
effects
on
breast
cancer
cell
line
invasion
and
colonization
.

Human
MDA

were
used
to

(
referred

By
survival
analysis
of

patients
,
JMJD6
was
found
to
be
significantly
associated

.

Over

expression
and
knock

down
of
JMJD6
in
breast

cell
lines
suggested
a
role
in

.

In
order
to
study
the
transcriptional

that
occur
following
JMJD6
expression
changes
,
siRNA

down
of
JMJD6
was
performed
in

To
determine
how
mutation
of
BRAF
affected
the
response
to
RAF265
,
we
utilized
a
tumor
orthotopic
implant
model
of
early
passage
melanoma
tumors
in
nude
mice
from
a
series
of
17
patients
with
advanced
metastatic
Tumor
growth
was
compared
between
RAF265
treatment
(
40
mg
/
kg
,
QD
)
and
diluent
control
groups
.

The
melanoma
associated
gene
mutation
profile
and
global
gene
expression
profile
were
determined
on
these
human
melanoma
samples
by
SNaPshot
and
Affymetrix
Human
Gene
ST
1.0
Array
,
respectively
.

Tumors
were
evaluated
for
growth
response
to
RAF265
in
an
orthotopic
implant
model
using
nude
mice
.

Comparisons
were
made
between
gene
expression
profiles
of
responders
and
non
-
responders
,
BRAF
mutant
and
BRAF
wild
type
tumors
.

Analysis
of
the
microarray
data
revealed
responders
exhibited
enriched
expression
of
genes
involved
in
cell
cycle
,
apoptosis
,
cell
-
cell
adhesion
and
initiation
of
epithelial
/
mesenchymal
transition
.

It
is
concluded
that
RAF265
significantly
inhibits
the
growth
of
a
sub
-
population
of
V600E
mutant
and
wild
type
BRAF
human
melanoma
tumors
in
vivo
and
the
gene
expression
profile
of
this
subset
of
tumors
that
may
predict
response
to
RAF265
.

tumors
was
extracted
and
hybridized
on
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

Injury
to
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS
)
may
result
in
lifelong
loss
of
function
due
,
in
part
,
to
the
regenerative
failure
of
CNS
neurons
.

 
Major
barriers
to
regeneration
faced
by
injured
CNS
neurons
include
inhibitory
proteins
derived
from
myelin
and
the
astroglial
scar
.

 
Previously
,
we
described
the
identification
of
a
novel
compound
,
F05
,
which
promotes
neurite
growth
from
neurons
challenged
with
inhibitory
substrates
in
vitro
,
and
promotes
axonal
regeneration
in
vivo
(
Usher
et
al
.
,
2010
)
.

 
To
identify
additional
regeneration
promoting
compounds
,
we
used
the
microarray
derived
gene
expression
signature
of
F05
to
query
the
Broad
Institute
Connectivity
Map
,
a
database
of
gene
expression
profiles
for
cells
treated
with
>
1,300
compounds
.

 
Unexpectedly
,
F05
induced
changes
in
gene
expression
remarkably
similar
to
those
seen
with
a
group
of
piperazine
phenothiazine
antipsychotics
(
PhAPs
)
.

 
We
found
that
,
in
contrast
to
antipsychotics
of
other
structural
classes
,
PhAPs
were
able
to
promote
neurite
growth
of
CNS
neurons
cultured
on
two
different
glial
-
derived
inhibitory
substrates
,
but
did
not
promote
growth
on
a
permissive
substrate
.

 
Pharmacological
studies
suggest
that
the
ability
of
PhAPs
to
promote
growth
depends
on
antagonism
of
calmodulin
signaling
,
but
not
on
dopamine
receptor
antagonism
.

 
Our
findings
shed
light
on
mechanisms
underlying
neurite
-
inhibitory
signaling
,
and
suggest
a
potential
pathway
for
development
of
novel
treatments
for
CNS
injury
.

Uveal
melanoma
is
an
aggressive
cancer
that
metastasizes
to
the
liver
in
about
half
of
patients
,
being
at
that
time
almost
always
fatal
.

Identification
of
patients
at
high
risk
of
metastases
may
provide
indication
for
a
frequent
follow
-
up
for
early
detection
of
metastases
and
treatment
.

The
analysis
of
the
gene
expression
profiling
of
primary
human
uveal
melanomas
showed
high
expression
of
SDCBP
(
encoding
for
syndecan
-
binding
protein-1
or
syntenin-1
)
,
which
appeared
higher
in
patients
with
recurrence
,
whereas
expression
of
syndecans
was
lower
and
unrelated
to
progression
.

Moreover
,
 
we
found
that
high
expression
of
SDCBP
gene
was
related
to
metastatic
progression
in
two
 
additional
independent
dataset
of
uveal
melanoma
patients
.

More
importantly
,
immunohistochemistry
showed
that
high
expression
of
syntenin-1
protein
in
primary
tumours
was
significantly
related
to
metastatic
recurrence
in
our
cohort
of
patients
.

Syntenin-1
expression
was
confirmed
by
RT
-
PCR
,
immunofluorescence
and
immunohistochemistry
in
cultured
uveal
melanoma
cells
or
primary
tumours
.

A
pseudo
-
metastatic
model
of
uveal
melanoma
to
the
liver
was
developed
in
NOD
/
SCID
/
IL2R
null
mice
and
the
study
of
syntenin-1
expression
in
primary
and
metastatic
lesions
revealed
higher
syntenin-1
expression
in
metastases
.

The
inhibition
of
SDCBP
expression
by
siRNA
impaired
the
ability
of
uveal
melanoma
cells
to
migrate
in
a
wound–†healing
assay
.

These
results
suggest
that
SDCBP
is
involved
in
uveal
melanoma
progression
and
that
it
represents
a
candidate
molecular
marker
of
metastases
and
a
potential
therapeutic
target
.

 
Gene
expression
profiles
of
29
unique
samples
from
uveal
melanoma
patients
were
measured
.

Histone
deacetylases
(
HDACs
)
have
been
identified
as
therapeutic
targets
due
to
regulatory
function
in
DNA
structure
and
organization
.

We
have
analyzed
the
role
of
the
LBH589
,
a
novel
pan
inhibitor
of
class
I
and
II
HDACs
,
in
Acute
Lymphoblastic
Leukemia
.

 
In
vitro
,
LBH589
was
shown
to
induce
a
dose
dependent
antiproliferative
and
apoptotic
effect
which
was
associated
with
an
increase
in
the
acetylation
of
H3
and
H4
histone
acetylation
which
was
uniformly
in
every
genetic
subgroup
of
ALL
.

In
vivo
administration
of
LBH589
in
BALB
/
c
-
RAG2-/-gammac-/-
mice
in
which
T
and
B
-
cell
leukemic
cell
lines
were
injected
induced
a
significant
reduction
in
tumor
growth
(
TOM-1
,
p<0.01
and
MOLT-4
p<0.05
)
.

Leukemic
cells
from
patients
were
employed
to
establish
a
xenograft
model
of
human
leukemia
in
BALB
/
c
-
RAG2-/-gammac-/-
mice
and
further
transplanted
in
consecutive
generations
of
mice
.

Treatment
of
these
xenografts
with
LBH589
induced
an
increase
in
the
acetylation
of
H3
and
H4
and
prolonged
the
survival
of
mice
in
comparison
with
the
animals
treated
with
Vincristine
and
Dexametasone
(
p<0.05
)
and
this
effect
was
significantly
higher
when
LBH589
was
combined
with
Vincristine
and
Dexametasone
(
p<0.001
)
.

Our
results
that
the
use
of
LBH589
in
combination
with
standard
chemotherapy
represents
an
attractive
option
for
treatment
of
patients
with
ALL
.

)
,
found
in
many
of
the
publically

,
leads
to
delayed

.

 
A
chemical
screen
in
zebrafish
identified
the
prostaglandin
compound
,
16,16
dimethyl
prostaglandin
E2
(
dmPGE2
)
,
to
be
a
critical
regulator
of
hematopoietic
stem
cell
homeostasis
.

 
We
hypothesized
that
an
ex
vivo
modulation
with
dmPGE2
prior
to
transplantation
would
lead
to
enhanced
engraftment
by
increasing
the
–¢effective–£
dose
of
hematopoietic
stem
cells
(
HSCs
)
in
cord
blood
.

 
A
phase
I
trial
of
reduced

double
UCB
transplantation
was
performed
to
evaluate
safety
,
rates
of
engraftment
and
fractional
chimerism
of
dmPGE2
enhanced
UCB
units
.

 
To
explore
potential
causes
of
the
lack
of
enhanced
efficacy
in
the
first
cohort
,
we
characterized
HSCs
to
determine
whether
the
prostaglandin
pathway
was
being
activated
under
the
ex

incubation
conditions
(
4–éC
,
10¬µM
dmPGE2
,
60

)
.

 
Incubation
conditions
were
identified
(
37–éC
,
10¬µM

,
120
minutes
)
that
maximize
the
activation
of
the
prostaglandin
pathway
by
dmPGE2
in
human
CD34

cells
.

  
Isolated

were
evaluated
(

for
2
hours
)
with
either
3

Klinefelter–•s
Syndrome
(
KS
)
is
one
of
the
common
chromosome
aneuploidy
diseases
in

.

iPSCs
,
are
similar
to
ESCs
in
terms
of
indefinitive
self

renewal
and
pluripotency
,
provided
an
alternative
choice
for
modeling
disease
to
facilitate
the

research
in

.

We
used
microarray
to
detect
the
global
reprogramming
of
KS
and
normal
fibroblast
cells
to
iPSCs
.

Also
we
used
microarray
to
explore
the
possible
molecular
varieties
between
KS
patient
and
normal
person
in
the
early

.

Fibroblast

were
reprogrammed
into
iPSCs
by
ectopic

is
characterized
by
important
biological

resulting
in
profound
pleomorphic
physiological
effects
termed
–¢uremia–£
,
whose
molecular
causation
is
not

.

The
data
was
used
to
study
gene

changes
in
uremia
using
whole

microarray
analysis
of
peripheral
blood
from
subjects
with
end

(
n=63
)
and
healthy
controls
(
n=20
)
to
obtain
insight
into
the
molecular
and
biological
causation
of
this
syndrome
.

The
study
was
conducted
at
the
University
of
British
Columbia
and
approved
by
the
human
ethics
research
board
.

A
3:1
case
-
control
design
was
employed
to
compare
gene
expression
in
patients
with
chronic
renal
failure
and
healthy
controls
.

Patients
with
stage
5
renal
disease
aged
18
to
75
years
,
who
were
clinically
stable
awaiting
renal
transplantation
,
were
not
receiving
immunosuppressive
medications
,
and
who
provided
written
informed
consent
were
enrolled
into
the
study
.

Patients
were
treated
according
to
Canadian
Guidelines
for
Chronic

Disease
(
13
)
.

Normal
controls
of
comparable
age
and
gender
to
the
patients
who
were
screened
to
ensure
freedom
from
known
illness
and
medical
therapy
served
as
comparators
.

To
investigate
the
potential
role
of
peptidylarginine
deiminase

(
PAD2
)
in
gene
expression
,
we
created
stable
shRNA
scrambled
control
and
PAD2
knockdown
MCF-7
breast
cancer
cell
lines
.

 
After
validating
the
specific
knockdown
of
PAD2
at
the
mRNA
and
protein
level
,
we
utilized
an
Agilent
microarray
platform
to
compare
the
gene
expression
profile
of
the
two
cell
lines
to
generate
a
candidate
list
of
genes
regulated
by
PAD2
.
Control
and
PAD2
knockdown
cells
were
created
by
stably
transfecting
shRNA
constructs
into
MCF-7
cells
.

 
Stable

were
selected
using

Glioblastoma
multiforme
is
the
most
common
and
aggressive
form
of
brain
cancer
.

The
use
of
oncolytic
HSV-1
(
oHSV
)
to
selectively
target
brain
cancer
cells
leading
to
their
lytic
destruction
has
shown
to
be
very
promising
in
a
preclinical
setting
,
but
is
lacking
efficacy
in
clinical
trials
.

Cyr61
,
a
secreted
extracellular
matrix
protein
which
functions
to
promote
angiogenesis
,
migration
,
proliferation
and
tumorigenesis
,
was
found
to
be
upregulated
rapidly
following
oHSV
infection
.

Here
we
show
,
using
microarray
analysis
,
that
Cyr61
expression
leads
to
the
induction
of
several
genes
with
type
1
interferon
function
.

We
show
that
Cyr61
mediated
type
1
IFN
induction
is
through
its
interaction
with
integrin
alpha6beta1
on
the
cell
surface
and
results
in
oHSV
inhibition
,
reducing
the
efficacy
of
this
therapy
.

We
used
microarray
to
detail
the
global
program
of
gene
expression
underlying
Cyr61
mediated
oncolytic
HSV-1
inhibition
and
identified
distinct
classes
of
up

regulated
genes
during
this
process
.

Tetracycline

Inducible
glioma
cells
expressing
Cyr61
protein
in
the
presence
of
doxycycline
were
treated
with
or

Peripheral
arterial
disease
(
PAD
)
is
a
relatively
common
manifestation
of
systemic
atherosclerosis
that
leads
to
progressive
narrowing
of
the
lumen
of
leg
arteries
.

Circulating
monocytes
are
in
contact
with
the
arterial
wall
and
can
serve
as
reporters
of
vascular
pathology
in
the
setting
of
PAD
.

We
performed
gene
expression
analysis
of
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
in
patients
with
PAD
and
controls
without
PAD
to
identify
differentially
regulated
genes
.

We
identified
87
genes
differentially
expressed
in
the
setting
of
PAD
;
40
genes
were
upregulated
and
47
genes
were
downregulated
.

We
employed
an
integrated
bioinformatics
pipeline
coupled
with
literature
curation
to
characterize
the
functional
coherence
of
differentially
regulated
genes
.

Notably
,
upregulated
genes
mediate
immune
response
,
inflammation
,
apoptosis
,
stress
response
,
phosphorylation
,
hemostasis
,
platelet
activation
and
platelet
aggregation
.

Downregulated
genes
included
several
genes
from
the
zinc
finger
family
that
are
involved
in
transcriptional
regulation
.

These
results
provide
insights
into
molecular
mechanisms
relevant
to
the
pathophysiology
of

Increased

)
in
diabetic
patients
underscore
the
need
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
underlying
molecular

.

Indeed
,
effective
HF
therapy
in
diabetic
patients
requires
a
complex
strategy
encompassing
the
development
of
improved
diagnostic

Mutations
in
the
parkin
gene
,
which
encodes
a
ubiquitin
ligase
,
are
a
major
cause
of
autosomal
recessive
parkinsonism
.

Interestingly
,
parkin
also
plays
a
role
in
cancer
as
a
putative
tumor
suppressor
.

Consistent
with
this
,
the
gene
is
frequently
targeted
by
deletion
and
inactivation
in
human
malignant
tumors
.

Here
,
we
show
that
parkin
expression
is
dramatically
reduced
in
glioma
cells
,
which
correlates
with
increased
cancer
mortality
.

We
further
show
that
restoration
of
parkin
expression
in
these
cells
promotes
their
arrest
at
G1
phase
and
significantly
mitigates
their
proliferation
rate
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

Notably
,
the
level
of
cyclin
D1
,
but
not
cyclin
E
,
is
reduced
in
parkin
-
expressing
glioma
cells
.

Moreover
,
parkin
expression
also
leads
to
a
selective
downregulation
of
Akt
serine-473
phosphorylation
and
VEGF
receptor
levels
.

Supporting
this
,
cells
derived
from
parkin
null
mouse
exhibit
increased
levels
of
cyclin
D1
,
VEGF
receptor
and
Akt
phosphorylation
and
divide
significantly
faster
compared
to
their
wild
type
counterparts
.

Importantly
,
analysis
of
parkin
pathway
activation
revealed
its
predictive
power
for
survival
outcome
of
glioma
patients
.

Taken
together
,
our
study
provides
a
mechanism
by
which
parkin
exerts
its
tumor
suppressor
function
and
a
signature
pathway
of
parkin
that
is
of
potential
prognostic
value
.

Total
RNA
obtained
from
U-87MG
cells
stably

We
excluded
children

,
with
underlying
chronic

conditions
(
i.e

The
RSV

consisted
of
51
patients
with
median
age
of
2
months
(
range

)
and
the

had
28
patients
with
median

of
 
5.5

(

.

 
Control

were
obtained
from

undergoing

or
at

visits
.

 
To
exclude
viral

we
performed
nasopharyngeal

of
all

.

We
recruited
10
control

for
the

with
median

for
the

.

We
used
microarrays
to
obtain
the
transcriptional
profile
of
PBMCs
from
patients
with
acute
RSV
or
Influenza
infection
and
compared
these
signatures
with
the
transcriptional

of
primary

infected
with

Influenza
.

The
present
study
has
focused
on
the
identification
of
the
differences
between
expression
patterns
of
kinin

genes
in
endometrial
cancer
For
microarray
analysis
 
20

were
used
:

Recent
identification
of
IL28B
gene
polymorphisms
associated
with
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
clearance
suggests
a
role
for
type
III
interferons
(
IFNs
)
in
hepatitis
C
infection
.

The
function
of
type
III
IFNs
in
intrinsic
antiviral
immunity
is
poorly
understood
.

 
Here
we
show
that
HCV
infection
of
primary
human
hepatocytes
results
in
a
robust
induction
of
type
III
but
not
type
I
IFNs
,
leading
to
IFN-
stimulated
gene
(
ISG
)
expression
.

 
In
addition
,
HCV
infection
elicits
a
much
broader
range
of
gene
expression
alterations
in
addition
to
ISG
induction
.

The
induction
of
type
III
IFNs
is
mediated
by
IRF3
and
NFkB-
dependent
pathways
.

 
Type
III
IFN
,
aside
from
upregulating
ISGs
with
a
different
kinetic
profile
,
induces
a
distinct
set
of
genes
from
type
I
IFN
,
potentially
explaining
the
functional
difference
between
the
two
types
of
IFNs
.

Chimpanzees
undergoing
experimental
HCV
infection
demonstrated
a
prompt
hepatic
induction
of
IL28
,
associating
with
ISG
upregulation
,
but
minimal
type
I
IFN
induction
.

Analysis
of
liver
biopsies
from
HCV
-
infected
patients
supported
a
close
correlation
among
hepatic
expression
of
IL28
and
ISGs
,
but
not
with
type
I
IFNs
.

   
Our
study
demonstrates
that
HCV
infection
results
predominantly
in
type
III
IFN
induction
in
the
liver
and
the
level
of
induction
correlates
with
hepatic
ISG
levels
,
thus
providing
a
mechanistic
explanation
for
the
association
between
IL28
,
ISG
levels
and
recovery
from
HCV
infection
as
well
as
a
potential
therapeutic
strategy
for
the
treatment
of
non

responders
.

Samples
were
treated
with
IFN

after

The
clinical
features
of
psoriasis
,
characterized
by
sharply
demarcated
scaly
erythematous
plaques
,
are
typically
so
distinctive
that
a
diagnosis
can
easily
be
made
on
these
grounds
alone
.

However
,
there
is
great
variability
in
treatment
response
between
individual
patients
,
and
this
may
reflect
heterogeneity
of
inflammatory
networks
driving
the
disease
.

In
this
study
,
whole
-
genome
transcriptional
profiling
was
used
to
characterize
inflammatory
and
cytokine
networks
in
62
lesional
skin
samples
obtained
from
patients
with
stable
chronic
plaque
psoriasis
.

We
were
able
to
stratify
lesions
according
to
their
inflammatory
gene
expression
signatures
,
identifying
those
associated
with
strong
(
37
%
of
patients
)
,
moderate
(
39
%
)
and
weak
inflammatory
infiltrates
(
24
%
)
.

Additionally
,
we
identified
differences
in
cytokine
signatures
with
heightened
cytokine
-
response
patterns
in
one
sub
-
group
of
lesions
(
IL-13
-
strong
;
50
%
)
and
attenuation
of
these
patterns
in
a
second
sub
-
group
(
IL-13
-
weak
;
50
%
)
.

These
sub
-
groups
correlated
with
the
composition
of
the
inflammatory
infiltrate
,
but
were
only
weakly
associated
with
increased
risk
allele
frequency
at
some
psoriasis
susceptibility
loci
(
e.g.
,
REL
,
TRAF3IP2
and
NOS2
)
.

Our
findings
highlight
variable
points
in
the
inflammatory
and
cytokine
networks
known
to
drive
chronic
plaque
psoriasis
.

Such
heterogeneous
aspects
may
shape
clinical
course
and
treatment
responses
,
and
can
provide
avenues
for
development
of
personalized
treatments
.

We
used
Affymetrix
microarrays
to
evaluate
genome

wide
expression
in
primary
human
keratinocytes
exposed
to
cytokines
.

Cytokine
activity
signatures
were
used
to
interpret
the
shifts
in
gene
expression
that
occur
in
psoriasis
plaques
relative
to
normal
uninvolved
skin
.

Primary
keratinocytes
from
three

(

were
obtained
and
were
either

or
exposed
to

(
IL-4
,
IL-13
,
IFN

,
IFN

gamma
and
TNF
)
.

For
the
IL17A
samples
,
primary
keratinocytes
were
obtained
from
six
donors
,
with
cells
derived
from
three

treated
with
IL-17A
and
cells
derived
from
the
other

inhibits

as
measured
by

This
leads
to

Small

Smac
mimetics
target
inhibitor
of
apoptosis
(
IAP
)
proteins
to
induce
TNF_-dependent
apoptosis
in
cancer
cells
and
several
Smac
mimetics
have
been
advanced
into
clinical
development
as
a
new
class
of
anticancer
drugs
.

However
,
preclinical
studies
have
shown
that
only
a
small
subset
of
cancer
cell
lines
are
sensitive
to
Smac
mimetics
used
as
single
agents
and
these
cell
lines
are
at
risk
of
developing
drug
resistance
to
Smac
mimetics
.

Thus
,
it
is
important
to
understand
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
intrinsic
and
acquired
resistance
of
cancer
cells
to
Smac
mimetics
in
order
to
develop
effective
therapeutic
strategies
to
overcome
or
prevent
Smac
mimetic
resistance
.

We
established
Smac
mimetic
resistant
sublines
derived
from
MDA

MB-231
breast
cancer
cells
,
which
exhibit
exquisite
sensitivity
to
the
Smac

,
and
used
microarrays
to
detail
the
global
programme
of
gene
expression
underlying
SM-164
resistance
in
MDA

cells
and
identified
differentially

in

Oxaliplatin

can
result
in

lesions
such
as
sinusoidal

.

Physiopathology
remains
unclear
and
variability
between
patients
suggests
that
there
is
individual
susceptibility
.

A
better
understanding
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
oxaliplatin
liver
toxicity
may
allow
to
identification
of
biomarkers

;
9
patients
with

after
a
short

and
10
patients
without
any

after
a

.

These
were
compared
with
a

The
ability
of
steroid
hormone
receptors
to
initiate
a
genetic
program
is
tightly
regulated
by
the
chromatin
environment
of
the
responsive
regions
.

 
Using
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
(
GR
)
as
a
model
factor
for
transcriptional
initiation
,
we
classified
chromatin
structure
through
Formaldehyde
Assisted
Isolation
of
Regulatory
Elements
(
FAIRE
)
,
a
technique
designed
to
identify
regulatory
regions
and
open
chromatin
within
the
genome
.

 
We
looked
at
dynamic
changes
in
FAIRE
signals
prior
to
and
following
activation
of
GR
with
its
ligand
,
dexamethesone
,
specifically
at
regions
of
receptor
interaction
.

 
We
have
found
a
distribution
of
GR
responsive
regions
that
respond
to
activation
by
varying
degrees
of
chromatin
modulation
.

The
majority
of
regions
that
demonstrate
GR
interaction
also
demonstrate
increases
in
FAIRE
signal
in
response
to
ligand
.

 
Most
of
these
GR
responsive
regions
fell
within
a
narrow
window
of
FAIRE
signal
in
the
basal
chromatin
state
,
suggesting
a
preferred
chromatin
structure
for
GR
recruitment
.

 
Supporting
this
notion
,
global
FAIRE
-
seq
data
indicated
an
enrichment
of
signal
surrounding
the
GR
binding
site
prior
to
activation
.

 
FAIRE
signal
induction
correlated
to
an
increase
in
nuclease
sensitivity
and
overall
FAIRE
signal
also
represented
a
general
accessibility
of
the
chromatin
.

 
Further
investigation
into
the
requirement
of
ATPase
-
dependent
chromatin
remodeling
showed
response
element
specific
effects
of
Brg-1
knockdown
.

FAIRE
induction
was
universally
decreased
by
Brg-1
depletion
,
but
to
varying
degrees
in
a
target
specific
manner
.

 
Taken
together
,
these
data
suggest
classes
of
nuclear
receptor
response
regions
that
react
to
activation
through
different
chromatin
regulatory
events
and
identify
a
novel
identifier
of
chromatin
structure
that
classifies
the
majority
of
response
elements
tested
.

Lactic
acidosis
and
hypoxia
are
two
prominent
tumor
microenvironmental
stresses
that
are
both
known
to
exert
important
influences
on
gene
expression
and
phenotypes
of
cancer
cells
.

But
very
little
is
known
about
the
cross
-
talk
and
interaction
between
these
two
stresses
.

We
performed
gene
expression
analysis
of
MCF7
cells
exposed
to
lactic
acidosis
,
hypoxia
and
combined
lactic
acidosis
and
hypoxia
.

We
found
the
hypoxia
response
elicited
under
hypoxia
was
mostly
abolished
upon
simultaneous
exposure
to
lactic
acidosis
.

The
repression
effects
are
due
to
loss
of
HIF-1
_
protein
synthesis
under
lactic
acidosis
.

In
addition
,
we
showed
lactic
acidosis
strongly
synergizes
with
hypoxia
to
activate
the
unfold
protein
response
(
UPR
)
and
inflammation
response
which
are
highly
similar
to
amino
acid
deprivation
responses
(
AAR
)
.

The
statistical
factor
analysis
of
hypoxia
and
lactic
acidosis
responses
indicated
that
ATF4
locus
,
an
important
activator
in
the
UPR
/
AAR
pathway
,
is
amplified
in
subsets
of
breast
tumors
and
cancer
cell
lines
.

Varying
ATF4
levels
dramatically
affect
the
ability
to
survive
the
post
-
stress
recovery
from
hypoxia
and
lactic
acidosis
and
may
suggest
its
selection
of
ATF4
amplification
in
human
cancers
.

These
data
suggest
that
lactic
acidosis
interacts
with
hypoxia
by
both
inhibiting
the
canonical
hypoxia
response
and
while
activating
the
UPR
and
inflammation
response
.

Gain
of
ATF4
locus
may
offer
survival
advantages
to
allow
successful
adaptation
to
frequent
fluctuations
of
oxygen
and
acidity
in
tumor
microenvironment
.

Collectively
,
our
studies
have
provided
linkage
between
the
short

transcriptional
responses
to
the

Rescuing
the
function
of
mutant
p53
protein
is
an
attractive
cancer
therapeutic
strategy
.

Using
the
NCI
anticancer
drug
screen
data
,
we
identified
two
compounds
from
the
thiosemicarbazone
family
that
manifest
increased
growth
inhibitory
activity
in
mutant
p53
cells
,
particularly
for
the
p53R175
mutant
.

 
Mechanistic
studies
reveal
that
NSC319726
restores
WT
structure
and
function
to
the
p53R175
mutant
.

 
This
compound
kills
p53R172H
knock
-
in
mice
with
extensive
apoptosis
and
inhibits
xenograft
tumor
growth
in
a
175

allele
specific
mutant
p53
dependent
manner
.

 
This
activity
depends
upon
the
zinc
ion
chelating
properties
of
the
compound
as
well
as
redox
changes
.

 
These
data
identify
NSC319726
as
a
p53R175
mutant
reactivator
and
as
a
lead
compound
for
p53
targeted
drug
development
.

We
utilized
gene
expression
microarrays
to
examine
the
transcriptional
activity
of
p53
targets
in
TOV112D
cells
after

with
NSC319726
.

was
the
first

.

This

was
designed
to
investigate
the

.

We
applied

In
this

we
examined
the
influence
of
seminal

in
human
Ect1

,
and
the
extent
to
which

.

Exposure
of
Ect1

resulted
in
differential
expression
of
a
total
of
3955
probe
sets
,
identified
using
high
stringency
criteria
with
MAS

.

These
corresponded
to
1338
genes
up

and
1343

.

TGF_3
treatment
of

resulted
in
differential

of
884
probe
sets
,
corresponding
to
346
up

and
229
down

.

The
genes
differentially
regulated
by

included
several
genes
associated
with

Of
47
genes
in
these
families
,
17
(
36.1

)
were
similarly
regulated
by
both

These
data
,
together
with
additional
experiments
showing
all
three
TGF

can
regulate
inflammatory

expression
in

,
identify
TGF

as
key
agents
in

We
used

programm
of
erythroid

p53
is
a
frequent
target
for
mutation
in
human
tumors
and
previous
studies
have
revealed
that
these
missense
mutant
proteins
can
actively
contribute
to
tumorigenesis
.

 
To
elucidate
how
mutant
p53
might
contribute
to
mammary
carcinogenesis
we
employed
a
three
-
dimensional
(
3D
)
culture
model
.

In
3D
culture
non
-
malignant
breast
epithelial
cells
form
structures
reminiscent
of
acinar
structures
found
in
vivo
,
whereas
breast
cancer
cells
form
highly
disorganized
and
in
some
cases
invasive
structures
.

 
We
found
that
mutant
p53
depletion
is
sufficient
to
phenotypically
revert
breast
cancer
cells
to
a
more
acinar
-
like
morphology
.

Genome
-
wide
expression
analysis
identified
the
sterol
biosynthesis
,
or
mevalonate
,
pathway
as
significantly
upregulated
by
a
tumor
-
derived
mutant
p53
.

 
Using
statins
and
sterol
biosynthesis
intermediates
,
we
demonstrate
that
this
pathway
is
both
necessary
and
sufficient
for
the
phenotypic
effects
of
mutant
p53
on
breast
tissue
architecture
.

Mutant
p53
associates
with
the
sterol
gene
promoters
at
least
partly
via
the
SREBP
transcription
factors
.

 
Finally
,
p53
mutation
correlates
with
higher
levels
of
sterol
biosynthesis
genes
in
human
breast
tumors
.

This
activity
of
mutant
p53
not
only
contributes
insight
into
breast
carcinogenesis
,
but
also
implicates
the
mevalonate
pathway
as
a
new
therapeutic
target
for
tumors
bearing
such
mutations
in
p53
.

RNA
was
isolated
from
three
independent
experiments
of
MDA-468.shp53
cells
cultured
under
3D
conditions
for
8
days
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
DOX
,
reversed
transcribed
and
hybridized
to
an
Affymetrix
GeneChip
expression
array
.

 
Data
was
processed
using
the
Robust
Multichip
Average
(
RMA
)
algorithm
to
give
expression
signals
and
paired

was
applied
for
each

In
psoriasis
,
inflammation
and
epidermal
hyperplasia
are
thought
to
be
controlled
by
T
cell
-
derived
cytokines
.

Evidence
now
suggests
that
Th17
and
Th22
cells
infiltrate
psoriasis
lesions
and
by
secreting
IL-17
and
IL-22
,
respectively
,
may
drive
disease
-
specific
gene
or
cell
responses
.

While
studies
in
model
systems
indicate
that
IL-22
has
a
dominant
pathogenic
role
,
there
is
evolving
evidence
that
IL-17
contributes
to
features
of
psoriasis
.

To
more
fully
understand
the
role
of
IL-17
in
human
disease
pathogenesis
,
we
examined
psoriatic
skin
lesions
obtained
from
patients
treated
with
an
anti
-
IL-17
(
IL-17
A
)
monoclonal
antibody
,
LY2439821
.

In
a
phase
1
,
randomized
,
double

,

-
controlled
dose
escalation
trial
,
patients
with
chronic
psoriasis
were
randomized
to
receive
3
doses
of
subcutaneous
LY2439821
at
5
mg
(
n=8
)
,
15
mg
(
n=8
)
,
50
mg
(
n=8
)
,
150
mg
(
n=8
)
or
placebo
(
n=8
)
at
weeks
0
,
2
and
4
.

Repeat
biopsies
were
taken
from
the
same
lesional
area
at
baseline
,
week
2
and
6
.

At
week
6
,
a
PASI75
was
observed
in
0/8
,
2/8
,
5/7
and
8/8
patients
receiving
5
mg
,
15

,
50

or
150

mg
LY2439821
respectively
and
0/8
patients
receiving
placebo
.

The
antibody
was
well
-
tolerated
.

In
patients
receiving
the
two
highest
doses
,
histological
and
immunohistochemical
analyses
of
biopsies
revealed
significant
reductions
from
baseline
in
keratinocyte
proliferation
,
hyperplasia
and
epidermal
thickness
after
2
weeks
,
as
well
as
reduced
infiltration
into
the
dermis
and
epidermis
by
T

(
CD3

)
and
dendritic

(
CD11c

,
S100A7
,

,
beta

and
LL37

cathelicidin
was
also
reduced
.

By
week
6
,
the
skin
appeared
normal
with
a
reversal
of
disease
defining
pathological
features
.

Quantitative
RT
-
PCR
revealed
decreased
expression
of
interferon
gamma
(
IFN

gamma
)
,
IL-22
and
IL-17
,
key
cytokines
from
T
cell
subsets
Th1
,
Th22
and
Th17
,
respectively
.

In
order
to
explore
the
extent
to
which
IL-17
blockade
influences
an
even
broader
set
of
inflammatory
or
psoriatic
disease
related
genes
,
mRNA
levels
from
skin
biopsy
samples
were
evaluated
using
whole
genome
microarrays
.

At
week
2
,
the
highest
dose
of
LY2439821
modulated
over
1500
genes
significantly
(
>
1.5
fold
change
[
FC
]
,
p<0.05
)
.

Of
these
,
51
genes
were
strongly
suppressed
(
>
7
-
fold
)
including
IL-19
,
lipocalin
,
amphiregulin
,
granzyme
B
,
and
several
chemokines
.

In
a
separate
analysis
,
those
genes
known
to
be
synergistically
regulated
by
both
IL-17
and
TNF
-
alpha
showed
the
greatest
normalization
in
expression
compared
to
genes
known
to
be
regulated
by
TNF
-
alpha
alone
,
IFN
-
gamma
or
Interferon
alpha
.

Our
data
suggest
that
Th17
cells
,
through
the
expression
of
IL-17
,
mediate
psoriasis
pathogenesis
,
and
that
neutralization
of
IL-17
with
LY2439821
suppresses
signaling
through
multiple
inflammatory
circuits
by
inhibiting
expression
of
cytokines
from
multiple
T
cell
subsets
,
as
well
as
chemokines
,
and
antimicrobial
proteins
from
keratinocytes
.

In

,
we
sought
to

We
reported
that

improved
the

We
also
provided

For
the

Clinical
Significance
:
Understanding
the
differences
in
colorectal
cancer
(
CRC
)
aggressiveness
and
clinical
outcomes
in
relation
to
tumor
stage
and
different
molecular
subsets
is
at
most
important
for
designing
treatment
regimens
.

However
,
molecular
signatures
for
specific
phenotypic
subsets
that
predict
the
aggressiveness
and
clinical
outcomes
of
CRC
,
specifically
in
advanced
disease
stage
are
lacking
.

Therefore
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
current
study
has
identified
a
set
of
molecular
markers
that
are
associated
with
aggressive
Stage
III
CRCs
that
exhibited
microsatellite
stable
and
mutant
p53
phenotypic
features
.

These
findings
might
aid
in
designing
aggressive
treatment
regimens
and
help
to
provide
insights
into
the
development
of
novel
therapeutic
targets
.

Results
:
Increased

In

,
SHP2
is
hyperactivated
either
downstream
of

.

We
provide
analysis
of
a
primary

grown
as
xenografts
in
the
presence

of
SHP2
for

,
the

was
induced
for

.

However
,
estrogens
potentiate

.

In
this

,
we
characterize
the

We
used

to
characterize
the

G9a
is
an

We
used
microarray

by
G9a
in
MDA

Statins
and
bisphosponates
(
BPs
)
are
two
distinct
classes
of
isoprenoid
pathway
inhibitors
targeting
HMG
-
CoA
reductase
(
upstream
enzyme
)
and
Farnesyl
-
pyrophospate
synthase
(
downstream
enzyme
)
respectively
.

Here
we
conducted
a
comparative
study
of
two
representatives
of
these
classes
,
fluvastatin
(
Fluva
)
and
Zoledronate
(
Zol
)
,
to
assess
the
differences
in
their
in
vivo
metastatic
potentials
and
pharmacogenomic
profiles
.

Both
drugs
,
being
administered
after
emergence
of
detectable
metastases
,
appeared
to
be
potent
metastasis
inhibitors
in
MDA
-
MB-231
breast
cancer
metastasis
model
.

We
observed
a
reduced
number
of
metastatic
sites
under
Fluva
,
but
not
Zol
treatment
.

Combinatorial
in

treatment
by
Fluva
and
Zol
showed
no
synergy
for
these
drugs
,
as
reported
earlier
on
the
basis
of
in

studies
(
Budman
DR
,
Oncology

)
,
staying
in
line
with
similarity
of
their
transcriptomic
profiles
.

Comparison
of
Zol
and
Fluva
transcriptomic
profiles
revealed
similar
patterns
of
affected
genes
(
describe

)
through
different
kinetics
(
when
treated
with
IC50
determined
for
72h
treatment
,
the
majority
of
changes
were
observed
after
24h
incubation
with
Fluva
,
and
only
after
48h
incubation
with
Zol
at
72h
-
IC50
or
after
24h
treatment
with
its
3
times
higher
dose
)
.

We
demonstrated
here
that
targeting
different
enzymes
of
the
same
pathway
neither
necessarily
leads
to
distinct
changes
in
gene
profiles
,
nor
to
synergy
for
in

potential
.

Subconfluent

(
concentrations
corresponding
to
IC50
at

)
for

and

,
or
treated
with
Zoledronate
for

(

¬µM
)
or
 
with

)
.

 
Mock

cells
were
obtained
in

Four

.

Total
of
40
samples
were
analyzed
(
10
conditions
with
4
replicates
for

)
.

To
determine
differentially
expressed
genes
,
differences
between
treated
cells
versus
corresponding
mock
-
treated
control
were
calculated
using
R
-
Bioconductor
statistical
environment
.

Pairing
was
made
to
remove

due
to
the

Docetaxel

in

prostate
cancer
.

However
,
most
patients
eventually
develop
resistance
to
this
treatment
.

The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
identify
key
molecular
genes
and
networks
associated
with
docetaxel
resistance
in
2
models
of
docetaxel
-
resistant

.

DU-145
and
PC-3
cells
were
converted
to
docetaxel
-
resistant
cells
,
DU-145R
and
PC-3R
,
respectively
.

Whole
-
genome
arrays
were
used
to
compare
global
gene
expression
between
these
4
cell
lines
.

Arrays
were
performed
by
triplicate
for
each
cell
line
.

There
are
two
major
subtype
of
cells
in
breast
cancer
.

These
cancer
cells
response
differently
to
glutamine
deprivation
,
here
we
use
one
luminal
type
of
breast
cancer
cell
(
MCF7
)
and
one
basal
type
of
breast
cancer
cell
(
MDAMB231
)
to
compare
the
gene
expression
differences
of
these
two
types
of
cancer
cells
in
glutamine
deprivation
.

Many
cancer
cells
depend
on
glutamine
for
survival
and
oncogenic
transformation
.

Although
targeting
glutamine
metabolism
is
proposed
as
novel
therapies
,
their
heterogeneity
among
different
tumors
is
unknown
.

Here
,
we
found
only
basal
-
type
,
but
not
luminal
-
type
breast
cancer
cells
,
exhibited
phenotypes
of
glutamine
dependency
and
may
benefit
from
glutamine
-
targeting
therapeutics
.

The
glutamine
independence
of
luminal
-
type
cells
is
caused
by
the
specific
expression
of
glutamine
synthetase
(
GS
)
,
a
pattern
recapitulated
in
luminal
breast
cancers
.

The
co
-
culture
of
luminal
cells
partially
rescued
the
basal
cells
under
glutamine
deprivation
,
suggesting
glutamine
symbiosis
.

The
luminal
-
specific
expression
of
GS
is
directly
induced
GATA3
and
down
-
regulates
glutaminase
expression
to
maintain
subtype
-
specific
glutamine
metabolism
.

Collectively
,
these
data
indicate
the
distinct
glutamine
phenotypes
among
breast
cells
and
enable
the
rational
design
of
glutamine
targeted
therapies
.

The
combination
of
peginterferon
and
ribavirin
is
the
standard
treatment
for
chronic
hepatitis
C.
 
Our
recent
clinical
study
suggests
that
ribavirin
augments
the
induction
of
interferon
stimulated
genes
(
ISGs
)
in
patients
treated
for
HCV
infection
[
1
]
.

 
In
order
to
further
characterize
the
mechanisms
of
action
of
ribavirin
,
we
examined
the
effect
of
ribavirin
treatment
on
ISG
induction
in
cell
culture
.

In
addition
,
the
effect
of
ribavirin
on
infectious
HCV
cell
culture
systems
was
also
studied
.

Similar
to
interferon
-
alpha
,
ribavirin
potently
inhibits
JFH-1
infection
of
Huh7.5.1
cells
in
a
dose
-
dependent
manner
,
which
spans
the
physiological
concentration
of
ribavirin
in
vivo
.

Microarray
analysis
and
subsequent
quantitative
PCR
assays
demonstrated
that
ribavirin
treatment
resulted
in
the
induction
of
a
distinct
set
of
ISGs
.

These
ISGs
,
including
IRF7
and
IRF9
are
known
to
play
an
important
role
in
anti
-
HCV
responses
.

When
ribavirin
is
used
in
conjunction
with
interferon
,
induction
of
specific
ISGs
is
synergistic
when
compared
to
either
drug
applied
separately
.

Direct
up
-
regulation
of
these
antiviral
genes
by
ribavirin
is
mediated
by
a
novel
mechanism
different
from
those
associated
with
interferon
signaling
and
intracellular
double
stranded
RNA
sensing
pathways
such
as
RIG
-
I
and
MDA5
.

RNA
interference
studies
excluded
the
activation
of
the
Toll
-
like
receptor
and
NF
-
KappaB
pathways
in
the
action
of
ribavirin
.

In
conclusion
,
our
study
suggests
that
ribavirin
,
acting
via
a
novel
innate
mechanism
,
potentiates
the
anti
-
HCV
effect
of
interferon
.

Understanding
the
mechanism
of
action
of
ribavirin
would
be
valuable
in
identifying
novel
antivirals
.

three
samples
were

fluid
(

collected
by

may
be

for

Therefore
we
compared
ELF

close

from
the
contralateral

from
patients
with

.

In

investigate
the
global
changes
in
host
gene
expression
during
the
interaction
of
human
bronchial
epithelial
cells
and
live
Alternaria

.

Human
bronchial
epithelial
cells
(
BEAS2
-

)
were
exposed
to
spores
or
media
alone
for
24
hours
.

RNA
was

and
used
to
assess
changes
in
gene

patterns
using

U133
Plus
2.0

.

Interestingly
,
many
cytokine

were
upregulated
.

Genes
involved
in
cell
death
,
retinoic
acid

were
also
significantly

Psoriasis
is
a
chronic
,
debilitating
,
immune
-
mediated
inflammatory
skin
disease
.

As
IFN
-
gamma
is
involved
in
many
cellular
processes
,
including
activation
of
T
cells
and
dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
,
antigen
processing
and
presentation
,
cell
adhesion
and
trafficking
,
and
cytokine
and
chemokine
production
,
IFN
-
gamma
-
producing
Th1
cells
were
proposed
to
be
integral
to
the
pathogenesis
of
psoriasis
.

Recently
,
IFN
-
gamma
was
shown
to
enhance
IL-23
and
IL-1
production
by
DCs
and
subsequently
induce
Th17
cells
,
important
contributors
to
the
inflammatory
cascade
in
psoriasis
lesions
.

 
To
determine
if
IFN
-
gamma
indeed
induces
the
pathways
leading
to
the
development
of
psoriasis
lesions
,
a
single
intradermal
injection
of
IFN
-
gamma
was
administered
to
an
area
of
clinically
normal
,
non
-
lesional
skin
of
psoriasis
patients
and
biopsies
were
collected
24
hours
later
.

Although
there
were
no
visible
changes
in
the
skin
,
IFN
-
gamma
induced
molecular
and
histological
features
characteristic
of
psoriasis
lesions
.

 
IFN
-
gamma
increased
a
number
of
differentially
expressed
genes
in
the
skin
,
including
many
chemokines
concomitant
with
an
influx
of
T
cells
and
inflammatory
DCs
.

Furthermore
,
inflammatory
DC
products
TNF
,
iNOS
,
IL-23
,
and
TRAIL
were
present
in
IFN
-
gamma
-
treated
skin
.

Thus
,
IFN
-
gamma
,
which
is
significantly
elevated
in
non
-
lesional
skin
compared
to
healthy
skin
,
appears
to
be
a
key
pathogenic
cytokine
that
can
induce
the
inflammatory
cascade
in
psoriasis
.

RNA
was
isolated
from
whole
skin
punch
biopsies
of
either
healthy
or
non
-
lesional
psoraisis
patients
at
baseline
or
24
hours
after
placebo
or
IFN
-
g
injection
.

Microarray
analysis
was
performed
to
evaluate
the
global
gene
expression
profiles
of
MCF-7
breast
cancer
cells
treated
with
tomato
leaves
extract
(
TLE
)
in
1
hr
and
48
hrs
of
treatment
.

Several
of
genes
with
p
<
0.05
and
fold
-
change
cut
-
off
<
2.00
from
human
genome
had
significantly
changed
after
the
treatments
.

Its
showed
the
greatest
roles
in
cancer
cells
growth
and
were
found
either
to
be
down
-
regulated
or
up
-
regulated
in
cells
after
the
treatment
.

TLE
gave
significant
expression
effects
towards
several
genes
such
as
CRYAB
,
PIM1
,
BTG1
,
CYR61
,
HIF1A
,
CEBP
-
beta
,
TXNIP
,
THBS1
,

.

These
results
demonstrate
the
potent
activity
of
TLE
as
an
anti

agent
.

The
NIAID
Systems
Virology
Center

Glioblastoma
(
GB
)
is
a
highly
infiltrative
tumor
recurring
in
90
%
of
cases
within
a
few
centimeters
of
the
resection
cavity
,
even
in
cases
of
complete
tumor
resection
and
adjuvant
chemo
/
radiotherapy
.

This
observation
highlights
the
importance
of
understanding
this
special
zone
of
brain
tissue
surrounding
the
tumor
.

It
is
becoming
clear
that
the
non
neoplastic
stromal
compartment
of
most
solid
cancers
plays
an
active
role
in
tumor
proliferation
,
invasion
and
metastasis
.

Very
little
information
,
other
than
that
concerning
angiogenesis
and
immune
cells
,
has
been
collected
for
stromal
cells
from
GB
.

As
part
of
a
translational
research
program
,
we
have
isolated
a
new
stromal
cell
population
surrounding
GB
by
computer
-
guided
stereotaxic
biopsies
and
primary
culture
.

We
named
these
cells
GB
-
associated
stromal
cells
(
GASCs
)
.

GASCs
are
diploid
,
do
not
display
the
genomic
alterations
typical
of
GB
cells
and
have
phenotypic
and
functional
properties
in
common
with
the
cancer
-
associated
fibroblasts
(
CAFs
)
in
the
stroma
of
carcinomas
.

In
particular
,
GASCs
express
markers
associated
with
CAFs
such
as
alpha
-
smooth
muscle
actin
(
_
-SMA
)
and
platelet
derived
growth
factor
receptor
-
beta
(
PDGFR
_
)
.

Furthermore
,
as
described
for
CAFs
,
GASCs
have
a
molecular
expression
profile
different
from
that
of
control
stromal
cells
derived
from
non
-
GB
peripheral
brain
tissues
.

GASCs
were
also
found
to
have
tumor
-
promoting
effects
on
glioma
cells
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.

The
isolation
of
GASCs
in
a
tumor
of
neuroepithelial
origin
was
unexpected
and
further
studies
are
required
to
determine
their
potential
as
a
target
for
anti
-
glioma
treatment
.

3
control
stromal
cells
and
4
GB
-
associated
stromal
cells
were
analysed
.

Hypothesis
:
Non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
is
characterized
by
a
multitude
of
genetic
aberrations
with
unknown
clinical
impact
.

In
this
study
,
we
aimed
to
identify
gene
copy
number
changes
that
correlate
with
clinical
outcome
in
NSCLC
.

To
maximize
the
chance
to
identify
clinically
relevant
events
,
we
applied
a
strategy
involving
two
prognostically
extreme
patient
groups
.

 
Results
:
Genetic
aberrations
were
strongly
associated
with
tumor
histology
.

In
adenocarcinoma
(
n=50
)
,
gene
copy
number
gains
on
chromosome
8q21
-
q24.3
(
177
genes
)
were
more
frequent
in
long
-
term
survivors
.

In
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(
n=28
)
,
gains
on
chromosome
14q23.1
-
24.3
(
133
genes
)
were
associated
with
shorter
survival
,
whereas
losses
in
a
neighboring
region
,
14q31.1
-
32.33
(
110
genes
)
,
correlated
with
favorable
outcome
.

In
accordance
with
copy
number
gains
and
losses
,
mRNA
expression
levels
of
corresponding
genes
were
increased
or
decreased
,
respectively
.

 
Conclusion
:
Comprehensive
tumor
profiling
permits
the
integration
of
genomic
,
histologic
and
clinical
data
.

We
identified
gene
copy
number
gains
and
losses
,
with
corresponding
changes
in
mRNA
levels
,
that
were
associated
with
prognosis
in
adenocarcinoma
and
squamous
cell
carcinoma
of
the
lung
.

Short
-
term
(
<
20
months
;
n=53
)
and
long
-
term
survivors
(
>
58
months
;
n=47
)
were
selected
from
a
clinically
well
-
characterized
NSCLC
patient
cohort
with
available
fresh
-
frozen
tumor
specimens
.

The
samples
were
analyzed
using
array
-
based
gene
expression
profiling
.

The
molecular
data
was
combined
with
information
on
clinical
parameters
.

Glioblastomas
(
GBM
)
may
contain
a
variable
proportion
of
active
cancer
stem
cells
(
CSCs
)
capable
of
self
-
renewal
,
of
aggregating
into
CD133
+
neurospheres
,
and
to
develop
intracranial
tumors
that
phenocopy
the
original
ones
.

We
hypothesized
that
nucleostemin
may
contribute
to
cancer
stem
cell
biology
as
these
cells
share
characteristics
with
normal
stem
cells
.

Here
we
report
that
nucleostemin
is
expressed
in
GBM
-
CSCs
isolated
from
patient
samples
.

The
significance
of
its
expression
was
addressed
by
targeting
the
corresponding
mRNA
using
lentivirally
transduced
short
hairpin
RNA
(
shRNA
)
.

We
found
that
an
off
-
target
nucleostemin
RNAi
(
shRNA22
)
abolishes
proliferation
and
induces
apoptosis
in
GBM
-
CSCs
.

Furthermore
,
in
the
presence
of
shRNA22
,
GBM
-
CSCs
failed
to
form
neurospheres
in
vitro
or
grow
on
soft
agar
.

When
these
cells
are
xenotransplanted
into
the
brains
of
nude
rats
,
tumor
development
is
severely
compromised
.

Attempts
were
made
to
identify
the
primary
target
of
shRNA22
,
suggesting
a
transcription
factor
involved
in
one
of
the
MAP
-
kinases
signaling
-
pathways
.

The
use
of
this
shRNA
may
offer
a
new
therapeutic
approach
for
this
incurable
type
of
brain
tumors
.

The
transcriptional
profile
of
neurosphere
cultures
infected
with
lentiviral
particles
containing
shRNA22
was
compared
with
the
profile
of
neurosphere
cultures
infected
with
lentiviral
particles
containing
control
shRNA
.

Experiments
were
done
in
triplicate
.

The
enzymatic
activity
of
HO-1
results
in
decreased
oxidative
stress
,
attenuated
inflammatory
response
,
and
very
often
in
a
lower
rate
of
apoptosis
.

This
is
due
to
removal
of
heme
,
a
potent
prooxidant
and
proinflammatory
agent
,
but
mainly
because
of
generation
of
biologically
active
products
such
as
CO
and
bilirubin
.

In
order
to
find
the
correlation
between
the
HO-1
level
and
the
expression
of
different
genes
of
interest
we
have
utilized
human
lung
cancer
cell
line
NCI
-
H292
stably
overexpressing
HO-1
.

Additionally
we
have
checked
if
HO-1
can
modulate
genes
expression
in
NCI
-
H292
cells
treated
with
TNF
.

The
effect
of
HO-1
overexpression
on
transcriptome
was
assessed
by
microarray
analysis
.

We
have
observed
that
the
increase
in
HO-1
level
may
affect
the
expression
of
different
genes
involved
in
cytokine
synthesis
,
angiogenesis
,
apoptosis
,
proliferation
and
cell
adhesion
.

Additionally
,
HO-1
may
interact
with
the
TNF
treatment
and
influence
the
expression
of
some
genes
like
IL-1
,
IL-6
,
IL-8
,
FAS
and
NF
-
kB.
NCI
-
H292
cells
,
control
(
pcDNA
)
and
stably
overexpressig
HO-1
(
pcHO1
)
were
treated
for
24
h
with
TNF
(
30
ng
/
ul
)
,
then
the
cells
were
lysed
and
RNA
was
collected
.

The
whole
human
gene
expression
profile
was
assessed
with
Agilent
microarray
analysis
.

Three
independent
experiments
were
performed
at
each
time
using
different
batch
of
cells
.

This
experiment
contains
the
subset
of
data
corresponding
to

,
which
goal
is
to
understand
the
dynamics
of
mammalian
transcriptome
evolution
.

To
study
mammalian
transcriptome
evolution
at
high
resolution
,
we
generated
RNA
-
Seq
data
(
_
3.2
billion
Illumina
Genome
Analyser
IIx
reads
of
76
base
pairs
)
for
the
polyadenylated
RNA
fraction
of
brain
(
cerebral

or
whole
brain
without
cerebellum
)
,
cerebellum
,
heart
,
kidney
,
liver
and
testis
(
usually
from
one
male
and
one
female
per
somatic
tissue
and
two
males
for
testis
)
from
nine
mammalian
species
:
placental
mammals
(
great
apes
,
including
humans
;
rhesus
macaque
;
mouse
)
,
marsupials
(
gray
short
-
tailed
opossum
)
and
monotremes
(
platypus
)
.

Corresponding
data
(
_
0.3
billion
reads
)
were
generated
for
a
bird
(
red
jungle
fowl
,
a
non
-
domesticated
chicken
)
and
used
as
an
evolutionary
outgroup
.

We
examined
the
effects
of
ligating
CD4
expressed
by
primary
human
peripheral
blood
monocytes
with
soluble
MHC
Class
II
.

3
replicates
are
included
.

Fresh
blood
monocytes
,
obtained
through
negative
selection
via
magnetic
activated
cell
sorting
(
Miltenyi
,
Auburn
,
CA
)
,
from
three
separate
individual
donors
were
treated
with
RPMI-1640
medium
alone
or
with
medium
containing
sMHC

(
1
ug
/
ml
)
for
three
hours
.

Cells
were
harvested
and
RNA
purified
using
the
RNeasy
procedure
(
Qiagen
)
.

RNA
was
then
analyzed
by
the
UCLA
Clinical
Microarray
Core
Laboratory
using
the
Human
U133
Plus
2.0
Array
(
Affimetrix
)
.

Data
was
analyzed
using
Dchip
software
.

Visual
inspection
did
not
find
any
potential
outliers
or
suspect
areas
.

Data
across
all
groups
were
normalized
using
the
PM

MM
difference
.

Atopic
dermatitis
(
AD
)
is
a
common
inflammatory
skin
disease
with
a
T(H)2
and
T22
immune
polarity
.

Despite
recent
data
showing
a
genetic
predisposition
to
epidermal
barrier
defects
in
some
patients
,
a
fundamental
debate
still
exists
regarding
the
role
of
barrier
abnormalities
versus
immune
responses
in
initiating
the
disease
.

An
extensive
study
of
nonlesional
AD
(
ANL
)
skin
is
necessary
to
explore
whether
there
is
an
intrinsic
predisposition
to
barrier
abnormalities
,
background
immune
activation
,
or
both
in
patients
with
AD
.

We
sought
to
characterize
ANL
skin
by
determining
whether
epidermal
differentiation
and
immune
abnormalities
that
characterize
lesional
AD
(
AL
)
skin
are
also
reflected
in
ANL
skin
.

 
We
performed
genomic
and
histologic
profiling
of
both
ANL
and
AL
skin
lesions
(
n
=
12
each
)
compared
with
normal
human
skin
(
n
=
10
)
.

We
found
that
ANL
skin
is
clearly
distinct
from
normal
skin
with
respect
to
terminal
differentiation
and
some
immune
abnormalities
and
that
it
has
a
cutaneous
expansion
of
T
cells
.

We
also
showed
that
ANL
skin
has
a
variable
immune
phenotype
,
which
is
largely
determined
by
disease
extent

perhaps
accounting

,
increased

of

was
among
the
most
obvious
differences
between
AL

,
potentially
reflecting
the

.

Our
study
implies
that
systemic
immune

might
play
a
role
in
alteration
of
the
normal
epidermal

,
as
suggested
by
the
high

of

Large

genomics
projects
are
profiling
hundreds
of
tumors
at
multiple
molecular
layers
,
including
copy

,
mRNA
and
miRNA

,
but
the
mechanistic
relationships
between
these

are
often
excluded
from

We
developed
a
supervised

framework
for
integrating
molecular

with
regulatory
sequence
information
to
reveal
regulatory
programs
in
cancer
,
including
miRNA

.

We
applied
our
approach
to
320
glioblastoma
profiles
and
identified
key
miRNAs
and
transcription
factors
as
common
or
subtype
-
specific
drivers
of

changes
.

 
We
confirmed
that
predicted

signatures
for
proneural

regulators
were
consistent
with
in

changes
in
a

We
tested
two

drivers
,
miR-124
and
miR-132
,
both
underexpressed
in
proneural
tumors
,
by
overexpression
in

and
observed
a
partial
reversal
of
corresponding
tumor

changes
.

 
Computationally

In
the
present
study
we
addressed
several
questions
related
to
the
mechanisms
of
cortical
injury
.

We
analyzed
genome
wide
gene
expression
by
microarrays
,
comparing
active
multiple
sclerosis
lesions
with
highly
inflammatory
lesions
of
chronic
tuberculous
meningitis
,
with
neurodegenerative
lesions
of
Alzheimer–•s
disease
and
with
normal
cortex
of
age
matched
controls
.

To
clarify
which
inflammatory
mediators
drive
demyelination
in
the
human
cortex
,
we
characterized
and
compared
the
gene
expression
profile
of
cortices
derived
from
patients
with
progressive
Multiple
Sclerosis
(
pMS
)
,
Meningitis
tuberculosis
(

)
,
Alzheimers
disease
(
AD
)
as
well
as
of
normal
cortex
from
age
matched
controls
.

3
cases
of
each
disease
were
included
into
the
study
.

Preceding
the
gene
expression
profiling
all
cases
were
characterized
histologically
and
areas
of
interest
were
identified
.

RNA
was
isolated
from
those
areas
,
amplified
and
hybridized
to
Agilent
G4112F
whole

microarrays
.

Global

were
collected
using
Agilent

(

carrying
723

.

Four

were
analyzed
:

Combination
of
platinum
-
based
chemotherapy
and
radiation
is
currently
the
standard
treatment
for
locally
advanced
lung
cancer
patients
.

However
,
therapeutic
resistance
to
these
therapies
may
arise
from
the
presence
of
cancer
stem
cells
(
CSCs
)
.

To
investigate
the
CSCs
hypothesis
of
chemo
-
radiation
resistance
,
we
used
microarray
assay
to
profile
CSCs
-
like
cisplatin
-
resistant
lung
cancer
cells
(
CDDP
-
R
)
versus
its
parental
cells
.

 
CDDP
-
R
cells
were
established
by
exposing
H460
lung
cancer
cells
to
3–í¬µM
cisplatin
for
7
days
,
followed
by
0.8
%
methylcellulose
selection
over
14
consecutive
days
.

–í
¬†
We
found
that
CDDP
-
R
cells
expressed
higher
levels
of
stem
cell
markers
,
including
CD133
and
ALDH
.

They
are
more
resistant
to
cisplatin-
and
etoposide
-
induced
apoptosis
and
to
high
radiation
dose
(
20Gy
)
.

Clonogenic
assays
suggest
that
CDDP
-
R
cells
were
more
resistant
to
radiation
than
parental
H460
cells
(
DER=1.21
,
p<0.01
)
.

Xenograft
studies
suggest
that
CDDP
-
R
cells
were
more
tumorigenic
(
p<0.001
)
.

Microarray
and
comprehensive
protein
interaction
networks
analyses
revealed
IGFBP3
as
a
highly
ranked
hub
protein
which
plays
an
important
role
in
the
mechanism
of
cisplatin
resistance
.

We
found
reduced
level
of
IGFBP3
and
enhanced
IGFR-1
activation
upon
IGF
stimulation
in
CDDP
-
R
cells
.

The
specific
targeting
of
IGF-1R
using
siRNA
resulted
in
significant
sensitization
of
CDDP
-
cells
(
DER=1.17
,
p<0.05
)
to
radiation
compared
with
the
parental
H460
cells
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
CDDP
-
R
cells
have
the
characteristics
of
CSCs
and
constitute
a
–≤–Ç—ösuitable–≤–Ç—ú
model
to
study
lung
CSCs
.

Profiling
of
CSCs
-
like
H460
cells
led
to
the
identification
of
IGF
as
an
important
pathway
for
chemo-
and
radiotherapy
resistance
in
lung
cancer
.

Affordable
early

We
measured
gene

The

(

was
computed
to
assess
the

.

We
identified

(

,
suggesting
a
similar

of

in

These
results
were
confirmed
in
two

in

study
(
n=212

and
a

The

discriminated
patients

from
healthy
controls
with
high
accuracy
(
AUC=0.81
,
95

)
.

Our
finding
suggests
the
use
of
gene
expression
from
PWB
for
the
identification
of
early
detection
markers
of
lung
cancer
in
the
future
.

Samples

The
remaining
162

were
processed
and
normalized
with
the
Robust

method
.

Nine
additional

were
excluded
after

The

We
hypothesized
that
microarray
analyses
of
whole

gene
expression
would
identify
patterns
of
gene
expression
useful
in
the
diagnosis
for
sacroidosis
and
identify
inflammatory

relevant
to
the
underlying
pathophysiology
.

We
analyzed
whole

RNA
from
37
patients
with
sarcoidosis
,
20
healthy
controls
and
6
patients
with
hypersensitivity
pneumonitis
using

microarrays
.

We
developed
a
classification
algorithm
using
a
derivation
and
validation
subset
approach
,
analyzed
the
most
discriminative
gene
expression
changes
,
and
confirmed

We
investigated
the
involvement
of
microRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
 
in
gastric
cancers
.

 
MiRNA
expression
was
profiled
from
 
40
cancerous

40
non

cancerous
tissues
obtained
from
the
National
Cancer
Centre
,
Singapore
,
and
Singhealth
Tissue

,
Singapore
.

 
We
identified
80
differentially
expressed
miRNAs
in
tumors
compared
with
normal
tissues
.

Among
these
miRNAs
,
we
identified
hsa
-
mir-486
-
5p
(
mir-486
)
as
a
significantly
downregulated
miRNA
in
GC
.

Subsequent
functional
characterization
revealed
that
mir-486
playing
a
tumor
suppressor
role
.

We
also
observed
frequent
genomic
deletion
of
mir-486
in
20
-
30
%
of
GCs
.

To
our
knowledge
,
mir-486
represents
one
of
the
first
tumor
suppressor
miRNAs
in
GC
inactivated
through
genomic
deletion
.

Alzheimer
's
disease
(
AD
)
is
a
devastating
neurodegenerative
disorder
that
threatens
to
reach
epidemic
proportions
as
our
population
ages
.

Although
much
research
has
examined
molecular
pathways
associated
with
AD
,
relatively
few
studies
have
focused
on
critical
early
stages
.

Our
prior
microarray
study
correlated
gene
expression
in
human
hippocampus
with
AD
markers
.

Results
suggested
a
new
model
of
early
-
stage
AD
in
which
pathology
spreads
along
myelinated
axons
,
orchestrated
by
upregulated
transcription
and
epigenetic
factors
related
to
growth
and
tumor
suppression
(
Blalock
et
al
.
,
2004
)
.

However
,
the
microarray
analyses
were
performed
on
RNA
from
fresh
frozen
hippocampal
tissue
blocks
containing
both
gray
and
white
matter
,
potentially
obscuring
region
-
specific
changes
.

In
the
present
study
,
we
used
laser
capture
microdissection
to
exclude
major
white
matter
tracts
and
selectively
collect
CA1
hippocampal
gray
matter
from
formalin
-
fixed
,
paraffin
-
embedded
(
FFPE
)
hippoc
ampal
sections
of
the
same
subjects
assessed
in
our
prior
study
.

Microarray
analyses
of
this
gray
matter
-
enriched
tissue
revealed
many
correlations
similar
to
those
seen
in
our
prior
study
,
particularly
for
neuron
-
related
genes
.

Nonetheless
,
in
the
laser
-
captured
tissue
,
we
found
a
striking
paucity
of
the
AD
-
associated
epigenetic
and
transcription
factor
genes
that
had
been
strongly
overrepresented
in
the
prior
tissue
block
study
.

In
addition
,
we
identified
novel
pathway
alterations
that
may
have
considerable
mechanistic
implications
,
including
downregulation
of
genes
stabilizing
ryanodine
receptor
Ca2
+
release
and
upregulation
of
vascular
development
genes
.

We
conclude
that
FFPE
tissue
can
be
a
reliable
resource
for
microarray
studies
,
that
upregulation
of
growth
-
related
epigenetic/
transcription
factors
with
incipient
AD
is
predominantly
localized
to
white
matter
,
further
supporting
our
prior
findings
and
model
,
and
that
alterations
in
vascular
and
ryanodine
receptor
-
relat
ed
pathways
in
gray
matter
are
closely
associated
with
incipient
AD
.

This

In

with

Further

,
while

,
is
much
greater
than
would
be

suggests
that
the

still

Breast
cancer
is
a
worlwide
health
problem
.

One
of
the
factors
involved
in
carcinogenesis
is
diet
.

Several
studies
indicate
that
resveratrol
,
a
polyphenol
present
in
diet
,
has
several
antitumor
properties
.

The
purpose
of
the
study
is
gain
an
insight
of
resveratrol
effect
in
cancer
by
determining
the
gene
expression
profile
of
breast
cancer
cell
lines
treated
with
the
compound
.

MCF7
cell
lines
were
treated
for
a
48
hour
period
with
two
concentrations
(
150
and
250
uM
)
of
resveratrol
.

9
plates
were
used
for
each
condition
.

The
RNA
obtained
from
3
plates
of
the
same
condition
was
pooled
,
processed
and
hybridized
to
the
Affymetrix

array
.

The

were
analyzed
using

Hypoxia
triggers
aggressive
cancer
growth
and
contributes
to
chemotherapy

.

Novel
therapeutic
strategies
aim
at
targeting
hypoxia
activated

pathways
.

Tumor
hypoxia
not
only
affects
neoplastic
tumor
cells
but
also
the
surrounding
stroma
cells
.

Therefore
,
a
novel
ex
vivo
model
was
established
,
which
allows
the
study
of
hypoxia
effects
in
fragments
of
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
with
preserved
tumor
microenvironment
and
3D

structure
.

Microarray
analysis
identified
107
significantly
regulated
genes
with
at
least
two
-
fold
expression
change
in
hypoxic
compared
to
normoxic
fragments
.

However
,
only
four
genes
were
significantly
regulated
in
both
subtypes
,
adenocarcinoma
and
squamous
cell
carcinoma
.

The
hypoxic
regulation
of
these
four
genes
was
verified
in
an
independent
set
using
quantitative
PCR
.

Non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
fragments
were
cultured
ex
vivo
under
hypoxia
or
normoxia
for
three
days
.

cDNA
microarray
analysis
was
performed
in
hypoxic
and
normoxic
lung
cancer
fragments
from
ten
patients
.

OSCC
is
associated
with
substantial
mortality
and
morbidity
.

To
identify
potential
biomarkers
for
the
early
detection
of
invasive
OSCC
,
we
compared
the
gene
expressions
of
OSCC
,
oral
dysplasia
,
and
normal
oral
tissue
from
patients
without
oral
cancer
or
preneoplastic
oral
lesions
(
controls
)
.

Results
provided
models
of
gene
expression
to
distinguish
OSCC
from
controls
.

RNA
from
167
OSCC
,
17

and
45
normal
oral
tissues
were
extracted
and
hybridized
to
Affymetrix
U133
2.0
Plus
GeneChip
arrays
.

The
differentially
expressed
genes
were
identified
using
GenePlus
software
and
the
validation
was
done
using
RT
-
PCR
,
using
independent
internal
and
external
datasets
.

A
gene
expression
profiling
sub

study
was
conducted
in
which
colonic
biopsy
samples
were
collected
for
RNA
extraction
and
hybridization
to
microarrays
from
48
patients
with
UC
who
were
participating
in
ACT
1
,
a
placebo
-
controlled
study
of
infliximab
.

Gene
expression
profiles
from
infliximab
responders
were
compared
with
those
of
baseline
and
infliximab
non
-
responder
samples
.

Infliximab
had
a
significant
effect
on
mRNA
expression
in
treatment
responders
,
with
both
infliximab
dose
and
duration
of
treatment
having
an
effect
.

 
Genes
affected
are
primarily
involved
with
inflammatory
response
,
cell
-
mediated
immune
responses
,
and
cell
-
to
-
cell
signaling
.

Infliximab
non
-
responders
had
a
molecular
phenotype
that
closely
resembled
that
of
untreated
patients
with
UC
.

 
Unlike
responders
,
non

responders
do
not
effectively
modulate
TH1
,
TH2
,
and
TH17
pathways
.

  
Gene
expression
can
differentiate
placebo
and
infliximab
responders
.

Patients
with
moderate

severe
,
active
UC
were
treated
with
infliximab
or
placebo
at
weeks

,
2
,
6
and
every
8
weeks
thereafter
.

 
Biopsy
samples
(
n=113

were
collected
from
48
patients
at

Acquired
drug
resistance
represents
a
major
challenge
in
chemo

therapy
treatment
for
various
types
of
cancers
.

 
We
have
found
that
the
retinoid
X
receptor–†selective
agonist
bexarotene
(
LGD1069
,
Targretin
)
was
efficacious
in
treating
chemo

cancer
cells
.

The
goal
of
this
microarray
study
was
to
understand
the
mechanism
of
bexarotene–•s
role
in
overcoming
acquired
drug
resistance
using
human
breast
cancer
cells
MDA
-
MB-231
as
a
model
system
and
paclitaxel
as
model
compound
.

 
After
MDA
-
MB-231
cells
were
repeatedly
treated
with
paclitaxel
for
8
cycles
with
each
cycle
including
a
3
-
day
treatment
with
30
nM
paclitaxel
and
followed
by
a
7
-
day
exposure
to
control
medium
,
MDA
cells
resistant
to
paclitaxel
were
developed
and
their
growth
was
no
longer
inhibited
by
paclitaxel
treatment
.

 
Those
MDA
cells
with
acquired
drug
resistance
,
when
treated
with
paclitaxel
and
bexarotene
in
combination
,
could
regain
their
sensitivity
and
their
growth
were
again
inhibited
.

 
Therefore
,

,
paclitaxel
-

MDA
cells
treated
with

Autism
spectrum
disorder
(
ASD
)
is
a
common
,
highly
heritable
neurodevelopmental
condition
characterized
by
marked
genetic
heterogeneity
.

Thus
,
a
fundamental
question
is
whether
autism
represents
an
aetiologically
heterogeneous
disorder
in
which
the
myriad
genetic
or
environmental
risk
factors
perturb
common
underlying
molecular
pathways
in
the
brain
.

Here
,
we
demonstrate
consistent
differences
in
transcriptome
organization
between
autistic
and
normal
brain
by
gene
co
-
expression
network
analysis
.

Remarkably
,
regional
patterns
of
gene
expression
that
typically
distinguish
frontal
and
temporal
cortex
are
significantly
attenuated
in
the
ASD
brain
,
suggesting
abnormalities
in
cortical
patterning
.

We
further
identify
discrete
modules
of
co
-
expressed
genes
associated
with
autism
:
a
neuronal
module
enriched
for
known
autism
susceptibility
genes
,
including
the
neuronal
specific
splicing
factor
A2BP1
(
also
known
as
FOX1
)
,
and
a
module
enriched
for
immune
genes
and
glial
markers
.

Using
high
-
throughput
RNA
sequencing
we
demonstrate
dysregulated
splicing
of
A2BP1
-
dependent
alternative
exons
in
the
ASD
brain
.

Moreover
,
using
a
published
autism
genome
-
wide
association
study
(
GWAS
)
data
set
,
we
show
that
the
neuronal
module
is
enriched
for
genetically
associated
variants
,
providing
independent
support
for
the
causal
involvement
of
these
genes
in
autism
.

In
contrast
,
the
immune
-
glial
module
showed
no
enrichment
for
autism
GWAS
signals
,
indicating
a
non
-
genetic
aetiology
for
this
process
.

Collectively
,
our
results
provide
strong
evidence
for
convergent
molecular
abnormalities
in
ASD
,
and
implicate
transcriptional
and
splicing
dysregulation
as
underlying
mechanisms
of
neuronal
dysfunction
in
this
disorder
.

To
identify
potential
A2BP1

dependent
differential
splicing
events
in
ASD
brain
,
we
performed
high
-

RNA
sequencing
(

on
three
autism
samples
with
significant
downregulation
of
A2BP1
(

Follistatin
is
a
folliculogenesis
regulating
protein
that
has
been
found
in
relatively
high
concentration
in
the
female
ovarian
tissues
.

Follistatin
acts
as
an
antagonist
to
the
function
of
Activin
,
which
is
often
found
elevated
in
ovarian
carcinogenesis
and
thus
presents
a
possibility
for
therapeutic
intervention
in
controlling
ovarian
cancer
.

Most
of
the
ovarian
cancer
occurs
in
its
ovarian
surface
epithelium
(
OSE
)
cells
.

Although
breast
cancer
susceptibility
gene
1
(
BRCA1
)
is
a
known
tumor
suppressor
for
breast
cancer
but
its
role
in
ovarian
cancer
is
beginning
to
unfold
.

We
have
shown
that
in
ovarian
carcinoma
cells
(
SKOV3
)
,
stable
overexpression
of
BRCA1
stimulates
Follistatin
secretion
and
simultaneously
downregulates
Activin
expression
.

Moreover
,
knock
down
of
BRCA1
in
immortalized
OSE
(
IOSE
)
cells
from
human
ovarian
tissue
demonstrates
downregulation
of
Follistatin
secretion
with
simultaneous
up
regulation
of
Activin
expression
.

IOSE
cells
generated
from
an
ovarian
cancer
patient
with
BRCA1
mutation
failed
to
secrete
Follistatin
in
the
medium
.

Our
results
indicate
a
novel
function
for
BRCA1
in
the
form
of
regulation
of
the
expression
of
Follistatin
in
the
ovarian

.

Background
:
Atopic
dermatitis
(
AD
)
is
a
common
inflammatory
skin
disease
exhibiting
a
predominantly
Th2/"T22
"
immune
activation
and
a
defective
epidermal
barrier
.

Narrow
-
band
UVB
(
NB
-
UVB
)
is
considered
an
efficient
treatment
for
moderate
to
severe
AD
.

In
psoriasis
,
NB
-
UVB
has
been
found
to
suppress
the
Th1
/
Th17
immune
polarization
with
subsequent
reversal
of
epidermal
hyperplasia
.

The
immunomodulatory
effects
of
this
treatment
are
largely
unknown
in
AD
.

Our
study
evaluates
the
effects
of
NB
-
UVB
on
immune
and
barrier
abnormalities
in
AD
,
aiming
to
establish
reversibility
of
disease
and
biomarkers
of
therapeutic
response
.

 
Methods
:
12
moderate
-
to
-
severe
chronic
AD
patients
received
NB
-
UVB
phototherapy
3
times
weekly
for
up
to
12
weeks
.

Lesional
and
non
-
lesional
skin
biopsies
were
obtained
before
and
after
treatment
and
evaluated
by
gene
-
expression
and
immunohistochemistry
studies
.

 
Results
:
All
patients
had
at
least
a
50
%
reduction
in
SCORing
of
AD
(
SCORAD
)
index
with
NB
-
UVB
phototherapy
.

The
Th2
,
T22
,
and
Th1
immune
pathways
were
suppressed
and
measures
of
epidermal
hyperplasia
and
differentiation
also
normalized
after
phototherapy
.

The
reversal
of
disease
activity
was
associated
with
elimination
of
inflammatory
leukocytes
,
Th2/"T22"-associated
cytokines
and
chemokines
,
and
normalized
expression
of
barrier
proteins
.

 
Conclusions
:
Our
study
shows
reversal
of
both
the
epidermal
defects
and
underlying
immune
activation
in
AD
.

 
By
determining
the
correlation
of
variables
with
therapeutic
response
,
we
have
defined
a
set
of
biomarkers
of
disease
response
that
associate
resolved
Th2
and
T22
inflammation
with
reversal
of
barrier
pathology
.

This
data
supports
the
"

Purpose
:
Gene
expression
signatures
developed
to
measure
the
activity
of
oncogenic
signaling
pathways
have
been
used
to
dissect
the
heterogeneity
of
tumor
samples
and
to
predict
sensitivity
to
various
cancer
drugs
that
target
components
of
the
relevant
pathways
,
thus
potentially
identifying
therapeutic
options
for
subgroups
of
patients
.

To
facilitate
broad
use
,
including
in
a
clinical
setting
,
the
ability
to
generate
data
from
formalin
-
fixed
,
paraffin
-
embedded
(
FFPE
)
tissues
is
essential
.

 
Experimental
Design
:
Patterns

and
FFPE
xenograft
tumor
samples
were
generated
using
the
MessageAmp

methodology
in
combination
with
assays
using
Affymetrix
arrays
.

Results
generated
were
compared
with
those
obtained
from
fresh

frozen
samples
using
a
standard
Affymetrix
assay
.

In
addition
,
gene
expression
data
from
patient

frozen
and
FFPE
melanomas
were
also
utilized
to
evaluate
the
consistency
of
predictions
of
oncogenic
signaling
pathway
status
.

 
Results
:
Significant
correlation
of
pathway
activity
predictions
was
observed
between
paired
fresh
-
frozen
and
FFPE
xenograft
tumor
samples
.

In
addition
,
significant
concordance
of
pathway
activity
predictions
was
also
observed
between
patient
matched
fresh
-

and
FFPE
melanomas
.

 
Conclusion
:
Reliable
and
consistent
predictions
of
oncogenic
pathway
activities
can
be
obtained
from
FFPE
tumor
tissue
samples
.

The
ability
to
reliably
utilize
FFPE
patient
tumor
tissue
samples
for
genomic
analyses
will
lead
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
biology
of
disease
progression
and
,
in
the
clinical
setting
,
will
provide
tools
to
guide

to
those
most
likely
to
be

on
proliferation
was
observed
only
when
both
MEK1
and
MEK2
were
knocked
down
indicating
that
neither
of
the
individual
MEK
isoforms
is
necessary
for
SK
-
MEL-28
cell
proliferation
.

 
To
test
the
sufficiency
we
inhibited
multiple
MEK
and
MKK
signaling
pathways
in
SK
-
MEL-28
cells
with
anthrax
lethal
toxin
(
LeTx
)
a

protease
and
rescued
individual
MEK
signaling
pathways
by
expressing
a
cleavage
-
resistant
form
of
MEK
(
MEKcr
)
.

 
In
this
fashion
ERK
activation
was
retained
only
in
MEK2cr

expressing
cells
but
not
in
MEK1cr
-
expressing

following

.

 
Microarray
analysis
revealed
groups
of
non

overlapping
downstream
transcriptional
targets
of
MEK1
and
MEK2
and
indicated
a
substantial
rescue

of
MEK2cr
on

.

 
Furthermore
LeTx
efficiently
inhibited
the
cell
proliferation
and
anchorage

of
SK
-
MEL-28
cells
expressing
MKK1cr
but
not
MEK2cr
.

 
These
results
not
only
indicate
that
in
this
cellular
context
MEK2
signaling
pathway
alone
is
sufficient
for
ERK
activation
melanoma
cell
proliferation
and
anchorage

independent

but
MEK1
is
not
but
also
demonstrate
that
MEK1
and
MEK2
signaling
pathways
are
not
redundant
and
interchangeable
for
melanoma
cell
proliferation
.

 
We
conclude
that
while
MEK2
alone
is
sufficient
for
SK
-
MEL-28
cell
proliferation
MEK1
can
conditionally
compensate
for
loss
of

Breast
cancer
is
genetically
and
clinically
heterogeneous
.

Triple
negative
cancer
(
TNBC
)
is
a
subtype
of
breast
cancer
usually
associated
with
poor
outcome
and
lack
of
benefit
from
target
therapy
.

A
pathway
analysis
in
a
microarray
study
was
performed
using
TNBC
compared
with
non
-
triple
negative
breast
cancer
(
non
-
TNBC
)
.

Overexpression
of
several
Wnt
pathway
genes
,
such
as
frizzled
homolog
7
(
FZD7
)
,
Low
density
lipoprotein
receptor
-
related
protein
6
(
LRP6
)
and
transcription
factor
7
(
TCF7
)
has
been
observed
in
TNBC
.

Focus
was
given
to
the
Wnt
pathway
receptor
,
FZD7
.

To
validate
its
function
,
inhibition
of
FZD7
using
FZD7shRNA
was
carried
out
.

Notably
decreased
cell
proliferation
,
suppressed
invasiveness
and
colony
formation
in
triple
negative
MDA
-
MB-231
and
BT-20
cells
were
observed
.

Mechanism
study
indicated
that
these
effects
occurred
through
silencing
the
canonical
Wnt
signaling
pathway
,
as
evidenced
by
loss
of
nuclear
accumulation
of
_
-catenin
and
decreased
transcriptional
activity
of
TCF7
.

In
vivo
study
revealed
that
FZD7shRNA
significantly
suppressed
the
tumor
formation
in
xenotransplation
mice
due
to
decrease
cell
proliferation
.

Our
finding
suggests
that
FZD7
involved
canonical
Wnt
signaling
pathway
is
essential
for
tumorigenesis
of
TNBC
.

Thus
,
FZD7
may
be
a
biomarker
and
a
potential
therapeutic
target
for
triple
negative
breast
cancer
.

The
goal
of
this

is
to

ERalpha
-
target
genes
affected
by
knocking
down
of
the
histone
arginine
methyltransferase
CARM1
in
MCF7
breast

cells
.

The
roles
of
CARM1
in
ERalpha+
breast
cancer
was
not
well
characterized
.

Therefore
,
we
created
a
Dox
inducible

line
where
CARM1
is
decreased
to
20
%
of

In

condition
,
cells
were
pre

treated
with
Dox
for
5
days
before
treating
with
E2
for
4
hours
.

3
biological
replicates
were
included
and
total
of
12
samples
were
analyzed
.

To
investigate
the
specific
gene
expression
program
by
which
mutant

p53
and

control
invasion
and

in
breast
cancer
cells
,
we
compared
the
transcriptomic
profile
of
control
,
mutant
-
p53

or
Pin1
depleted
MDA

MB-231
cells
.

MDA

MB-231
cells
were
transfected
twice
with
siRNA
against
Pin1
,
p53
or
LacZ
as
a
control
.

Transfections
were
performed
by
using
Lifofectamine

(
Invitrogen
)
according
to
manufacture

.

Forty

eight
hours
after
second

,
samples
were
then
processed
for
total
RNA
extraction
and
hybridization
on
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

Three
biological

(

Global
,
genomic
responses
of
erythrocytes
to
infectious
agents
have
been
difficult
to
measure
,
because
these
cells
are
e
-
nucleated
.

We
have
previously
demonstrated
that
in

matured
,
nucleated
erythroblast
cells
at
the
orthochromatic
stage
can
be
efficiently
infected
by
the
human
malaria
parasite
Plasmodium
falciparum
.

We
now
show
that
infection
of
orthochromatic
cells
induces
change
in
609
host
genes
.

592
of
these
transcripts
are
up
-
regulated
and
associated
with
metabolic
and
chaperone
pathways
unique
to
P.
falciparum
infection
,
as
well
as
a
wide
range
of
signaling
pathways
that
are
also
induced
in
related
apicomplexan
infections
of
mouse
hepatocytes
or
human
fibroblast
cells
.

Our
data
additionally
show
that
polychromatophilic
cells
,
which
precede
the
orthochromatic
stage
and
are
not
infected
when
co
-
cultured
with
P.
falciparum
,
up
-
regulate
a
small
set
of
35
genes
,
9
of
which
are
associated
with
pathways
of
hematopoiesis
and/or
erythroid
cell
development
.

These
data
unexpectedly
predict
that
blood
stage
P.
falciparum
may
induce
host
responses
common
to
infections
of
other
pathogens
.

Further
P.
falciparum
may
modulate
gene
expression
in
bystander
erythroblasts
and
thus
influence
pathways
of

development
.

Human

were
cultured
until

stages
of
differentiation
and
served
as
uninfected

.

Of
the

three
were
used
to
initiate

For

all

and
thus
achieve
superior

for

we
obtained

its

and
estradiol
in

and
analyzed
the
gene

signatures
associated
with
each

using
the

This

indicates
that

data
mining
provide
a
powerful
approach
to
discover
unknown
mechanisms
of

and
identify

.

We
profiled
the

,
as
well
as

Medulloblastoma
(
MB
)
is
the
most
common
malignant
brain
tumor
in
children
,
among
whom
overexpression
or
amplification
of
MYC
oncogenes
has
been
associated
with
poor
clinical
outcome
.

Although
the
MYC
functions
during
normal
development
and
oncogenesis
in
various
systems
have
been
extensively
investigated
,
the
transcriptional
targets
mediating
MYC
effects
in
MB
are
still
elusive
.

Their
identification
and
roles
during
MB
onset
and
progression
are
important
and
will
ultimately
suggest
novel
potential
therapeutic
targets
.

cDNA
microarray
analysis
was
used
to
compare
the
effects
of
overexpressing
and
silencing
MYC
on
the
transcriptome
of
a
MB
-
derived
cell
line
.

We
identified
209
genes
with
potential
relevance
to
MYC
-
dependent
cellular
responses
in
MB
.

Among
the
MYC
-
responsive
genes
,
we
found
members
of
the
bone
morphogenetic
protein
(
BMP
)
signaling
pathway
,
which
plays
a
crucial
role
during
the
development
of
the
cerebellum
.

In
particular
,
the
cytokine
gene
BMP7
was
identified
as
a
direct
target
of
MYC
in
MB
cells
.

Similar
to
the
effect
induced
by
BMP7
silencing
by
siRNA
,
the
use
of
a
small
-
molecule
inhibitor
of
the
BMP
/
SMAD
signaling
pathway
reduced
cell
viability
in
a
panel
of
MB
cells
.

Altogether
,
our
findings
indicate
that
high
MYC
levels
drive
BMP7
expression
in
MB
to
induce
pro
-
survival
and
pro
-
proliferative
cellular
pathways
.

This
observation
suggests
that
targeting
the
BMP
/
SMAD
pathway
may
be
a
new
therapeutic
concept
for
the
treatment
of
childhood

.

Menopausal
estrogen
(
E2
)
replacement
therapy
increases
the
risk
of
estrogen
receptor
(
ER)-positive
epithelial
ovarian
cancers
(
EOC
)
.

Whether
E2
is
tumorigenic
or
promotes
expansion
of
undiagnosed
pre
-
existing
disease
is
unknown
.

To
determine
E2
effects
on
tumor
promotion
,
we
developed
an
intraperitoneal
mouse
xenograft
model
using
ZsGreen
fluorescent
ER-
2008
and
ER+
PEO4
human
EOC
cells
.

Tumor
growth
was
quantified
by
in

fluorescent
imaging
.

In
ER+
tumors
,
E2
significantly
increased
size
,
induced
progesterone
receptors
,
and
promoted
lymph
node
metastasis
,
confirming
that
ER
are
functional
and
foster
aggressiveness
.

Laser
captured
human
EOC
cells
from
ER-
and
ER+
xenografted
tumors
were
profiled
for
expression
of
E2
-
regulated
genes
.

Three
classes
of
E

regulated
EOC
genes
were
defined
,
but
less
than
10
%
were
shared
with
E
-
regulated
breast
cancer
genes
.

Since
breast
cancer
selective
ER
modulators
(
SERM
)
are
therapeutically
ineffective
in
EOC
,
we
suggest
that
our
EOC
-
specific
E
-
regulated
genes
can
assist
pharmacologic
discovery
of
ovarian
targeted
SERM
.

15

in
this

with

and
insulin

like

factor
(

signaling
are
important
for

cancer
,
cross
-
talk
between
these
pathways
,
particularly
at
the
level
of
gene
transcription
,
remains
poorly
understood
.

 
We
performed
microarray
analysis
on
MCF-7
breast
cancer
cells
treated
with
estradiol
(
E2
)
or
IGF
-
I
for
3hr
or
24hr
.

 
IGF
-
I
regulated
mRNA
of
5
-
10
-
fold
more
genes
than
estradiol
,
and
many
genes
were
co
-
regulated
by
both
ligands
.

 
Importantly
,
expression
of
these
co
-
regulated
genes
correlated
with
poor
prognosis
of
human
breast
cancer
.

 
Closer
examination
revealed
enrichment
of
repressed
transcripts
.

 
Interestingly
,
a
number
of
potential
tumor
suppressors
were
down
-
regulated
by
IGF
-
I
and
estradiol
.

 
In
fact
,
BLNK
,
one
of
the
top
repressed
genes
,
is
a
potential
growth
suppressor
in
breast
cancer
cells
.

 
Analysis
of
three
down
-
regulated
genes
showed
that
E2
-
mediated
repression
occurred
independently
of
IGF
-
IR
,
and
IGF
-
I
-
mediated
repression
occurred
independently
of
ER
.

 
However
,
repression
by
IGF
-
I
or
estradiol
required
common
downstream
kinases
.

 
In
conclusion
,
E2
and
IGF
-
I
co
-
regulate
a
set
of
genes
that
affect
breast
cancer
outcome
.

 
There
is
enrichment
of
repressed
transcripts
,
and
the
down
-
regulation
is
independent
at
the
receptor
level
.

 
This
may
be
important
clinically
,
as
tumors
with
active
ER
and
IGF
-
IR
signaling
may
require
co
-
targeting
of
both
pathways
.

these
being
up
-
regulated
in
pII
cells
.

Changes
were
associated
with
genes
whose
products
are
involved
in
cell
motility
,
loss
of
cellular
adhesion
and
interaction
with
the
extracellular
matrix
.

Selective
analysis
of
the
data
also
showed
a
shift
from
luminal
to
basal
cell
markers
and
increased
expression
of
a
wide
spectrum
of
genes
normally
associated
with
mesenchymal
characteristics
,
with
consequent
loss
of
epithelial
specific
markers
.

Over
-
expression
of
several
peptide
growth
factors
and
their
receptors
are
indicative
of
an
increased
contribution
to
the
higher
proliferative
rates
of
pII
cells
as
well
as
aiding
their
potential
for
metastatic
activity
.

Signalling
molecules
that
have
been
identified
as
key
transcriptional
drivers
of
epithelial
to
mesenchymal
transition
were
also
found
to
be
elevated
in
pII
cells
.

We
suggest
that
these
data
support
our
hypothesis
that
induced
loss
of
estrogen
receptor
in
previously
antiestrogen
sensitive
cells
is
a
trigger
for
the
concomitant
loss
of
endocrine
dependence
and
onset
of
a
series
of
possibly
parallel
events
that
changes
the
cell
from
an
epithelial
to
a
mesenchymal
type
.

Inhibition
of
this
transition
through
targeting
of
specific
mediators
may
be
a
useful
supplementary
strategy
to
circumvent
the
effects
of
loss
of
endocrine
sensitivity
.

We
used
microarrays
to
detail
the
global
programme
of
gene
expression
underlying
Epithelial
to
mesenchymal
transition
and
identified
distinct
classes
of
regulated
genes
during
this
process
.

,
we
employed
the

.

MPS-1
was

in
human
gastric

and
the
transfectants
named

while
the

named

.

Genes
with
greater

fold
change
and
P

value
_
0.05
were
identified
as
differentially
expressed
genes
between
NC
and
P4
cells
.

Among
those
,
apoptotic

gene
(

,
etc
)
and

etc
)
were
quantified
by

as
well
as

.

The
two
groups
of
negative
control
(
NC
)
and
MPS-1
knockdown
gastric
cancer
cells
(

)
were
harvested
after

.

Three
independent
experiments
were
performed
for
each
group
.

The
taxanes
,
namely
Paclitaxel
and
Docetaxel
,
are
important
and
widely
used
cancer
chemotherapy
drugs
in
the
treatment
of
invasive
and
metastatic
human
breast
cancer
.

 
Although
treatment
with
the
taxanes
is
beneficial
to
many
patients
,
drug
-
responsive
tumors
in
patients
with
metastatic
breast
cancer
often
display
resistance
to
these
drugs
,
either
initially
or
over
time
following
the
continued
administration
of
chemotherapy
drugs
.

 
To
investigate
the
patterns
of
cross
-
resistance
with
the
taxane
drugs
and
to
identify
potential
mechanisms
of
resistance
,
we
generated
a
series
of
MDA
-
MB-231
taxane
resistant
cell
lines
.

We
then
used
microarrays
to
determine
gene
expression
differences
between
sensitive
,
Docetaxel
and
Paclitaxel
resistant
MDA
-
MB-231
cells
.

Rationale
:
Chronic
Obstructive
Pulmonary
Disease
(
COPD
)
is
considered
a
chronic
inflammatory
disease
characterized
by
progressive
airflow
limitation
and
also
has
significant
extrapulmonary
(
systemic
)
effects
that
lead
to
comorbid
conditions
.

Very
little
is
known
about
the
pathomechanism
of
the
disease
.

 
Objectives
:

Among
inflammatory
cell
types
,
alveolar
macrophages
appear
to
have
a
key
role
in
initiating
and/or
sustaining
disease
progression
.

These
cells
are
derived
from
peripheral
monocytes
.

Identification
of
disease
and
cell
type
specific
gene
expression
profiles
can
be
revealing
and
also
practically
useful
in
order
to
diagnose
and
characterize
disease
progression
and
the
effect
of
drug
treatment
.

 
Methods
:
We
used
Affymetrix
microarrays
to
obtain
gene
expression
data
of
alveolar
macrophages
and
circulating
monocytes
of
COPD
and
healthy
control
patients
.

The
microarray
results
were
confirmed
by
quantitative
real
-
time
polymerase
chain
reaction
in
multiple
patient
collections
.

 
Measurements
and
Main
Results
:
We
have
identified
gene
sets
specifically
associated
with
COPD
in
alveolar
macrophages
and
also
in
monocytes
.

Immune
function
,
responses
to
stimuli
,
and
cell
death
related
genes
appear
to
be
impacted
in
both
cell
types
.

Remarkably
,
there
is
an
overlapping
gene
set
between
the
two
cell
types
.

 
Conclusions
:
Taken
together
,
our
data
show
that
COPD
-
specific
gene
signatures
can
be
identified
and
validated
,
and
that
the
disease
also
affects
peripheral
monocytes
.

Moreover
,
monocytes
and
alveolar
macrophages
carry
overlapping
gene
expression
signatures
.

Our
findings
further
support
the
notion
that
altered
responsiveness
to
stimuli
is
the
key
characteristic
of
alveolar
macrophages
and
also
of
their
precursors
,
peripheral
monocytes
.

Brochoalveolar
lavage
fluid
samples
were
collected
from
of
COPD
and
healthy
control
patients
.

Alveolar
macrophages
were
isolated
using
Percoll
gradient
centrifugation
,
isolated
using
CD14
+
magnetic
beads
,
and
total
RNA
was
extracted
using
Qiagen
RNeasy
Kit
.

The
monocyte
samples
represent
a
pool
of
RNA
from
5
patients
.

Total
RNA
was
labeled
with
biotin
and
individual
samples
were
hybridized
to
Affymetrix
HG
U133A
GeneChips
.

 
Affymetrix
data
files
were
analyzed
using
GeneSpring
7.3
software
.

Using
a
non
-
parametric
statistical
test
,
we
compared
the
gene
expression
patterns
of
the
COPD
and
the
healthy
control
patients
and
identified
a
set
a
genes
that
showed
differential
expression
between
the
two
groups
.

Studies

and

)
when
treated

CG-1521
alone
and
in
combination
with

nM

.

Comparisons
between
each
treatment
group
provides
evidence
for
the
dysregulation
of
genes
associated
with
the
spindle
assembly
checkpoint
.

Three
independent
experiments
were
carried
out
in
SUM149PT
and
SUM190PT
cells
,
which
were
treated
with
vehicle
(
ethanol
/
DMSO
)
,
10nM
17beta

,

or

,
and

.

Total
RNA
was
extracted
from
cell
lysates
using
QIAGEN
RNeasy
mini
kit
after
48h
of
treatment
.

Human
healthy
tissue
samples
,
DCIS
and
invasive
mammary
tumors
were
analyzed
in
order
to
identify
marker
genes
which
show
enhanced
expresssion
in
DCIS
and
invasive
ductal
carcinomas
.

Using
this
approach
,
we
were
able
to
identify
a
set
of
genes
which
might
allow
a
better
detection
of
DCIS
and
invasive
carcinomas
in
the
future
.

5
healthy
tissue
samples
,
9
DCIS
and
5
invasive
ductal
carcinomas
were
analysed
.

The
second
leading
cause
of
cancer
death
for
women
in
the
U.S.
is
breast
cancer
.

 
Moreover
,
a
significant
number
of
patients
with
breast
tumors
acquire
resistance
to
drugs
during
therapy
.

To
develop
targeted
therapeutic
strategies
to
combat
drug
resistance
it
is
essential
to
understand
the
basic
molecular
mechanisms
through
which
cancer
cells
control
sensitivity
to
chemotherapeutics
.

To
identify
new
candidate
genes
and
facilitate
the
discovery
of
novel
drug
resistance
pathways
,
we
have
generated
a
resistance
profile
or
 
–§resistome–•
of
 
etoposide
resistant
MCF7
breast
cancer
cells
.

Differential
expression
of
over
5000
genes
(
fold
change
>
2
,
P
value
<
0.05
)
indicate
that
several
drug
resistance
mechanisms
may
be
operating
in
these
cells
,
including
up
-
regulation
of
ABC
transporter
genes
,
down
-
regulation
of
the
drug
target
and
down
-
regulation
of
apoptotic
genes
.

Several
transcription
factors
such
as
RUNX2
,
SOX9
,
ETS1
and
SMAD3
were
up
-
regulated
in
the
drug
resistant
cells
.

Targeted
RUNX2
knockdown
in
the
resistant
cells
using
siRNA
increased
sensitivity
to
etoposide
and
also
upregulated
expression
of
pro
-
apoptotic
genes
indicating
that
RUNX2
could
be
a
molecular
target
against
etoposide
resistance
.

Differential
miRNA
(
microRNA
)
expression
was
observed
among
the
drug
resistant
and
sensitive
cells
suggesting
that
miRNA
may
also
play
a
role
in
regulation
of
drug
resistance
.

Hsa
-
miR-218
,
which
targets
ABCC6
,
was
down
-
regulated
in
the
drug
resistant
cell
line
.

Transfection
of
a
miR-218
mimic
could
down
-
regulate
the
expression
of
the
efflux
pump
ABCC6
by
65
%
in
drug
resistant
cells
suggesting
that
regulation
of
miRNA
may
play
an
important
role
in
etoposide
resistance
.

RNA
from
MCF7
and
etoposide
-
resistant
MCF7
(
MCF7VP
)
cell
lines
were
hybridized
to
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

Both
samples
were
run
in

Gamma

however
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
are
not
completely
understood
.

We
used
microarrays
to
detail
the
global
programme
of
gene
expression
underlying
the
effects
of
gamma
tocotrienols
on
MCF-7
cells
and
identified
distinct
classes
of
up
-
regulated
genes
during
this
process
.

MCF-7
cells
were
grown
in
DMEM
medium
with
5
%
FBS
.

The
cells
were
treated
with
vehicle
control
(
DMSO
)
or
40
uM
of
gamma
tocotrienol
for
24
h
for
RNA
extraction
and
hybridization
on
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

Four
independent
experiments
were
performed
.

The
mechanisms
and
molecular
pathways
underlying
interstitial
lung
diseases
(
ILDs
)
are
poorly
understood
.

Systems
biology
approaches
were
used
to
identify
perturbed
networks
in
these
disease
states
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
underlying
mechanisms
of
disease
.

Through
profiling
genes
and
miRNAs
,
we
found
subsets
of
genes
and
miRNAs
that
distinguish
different
disease
stages
,
ILDs
from
controls
,
and
idiopathic
pulmonary
fibrosis
(
IPF
)
from
non
-
specific
interstitial
pneumonitis
(
NSIP
)
.

 
Traditional
pathway
analysis
revealed
several
disease
-
associated
modules
involving
genes
from
the
TGF
-
beta
,
Wnt
,
focal
adhesion
and
smooth
muscle
actin
pathways
that
may
be
involved
in
advancing
fibrosis
.

A
comprehensively
integrative
approach
was
used
to
construct
a
global
gene
regulatory
network
based
on
the
perturbation
of
key
regulatory
elements
,
transcriptional
factors
and
miRNAs
.

 
The
data
also
demonstrated
that
several
subnetworks
were
significantly
associated
with
key
molecules
involved
in
the
diseases
.

 
We
present
a
broad
overview
of
the
disease
at
a
molecular
level
and
discuss
several
possibly
key
regulatory
molecular
circuits
that
could
play
central
roles
in
facilitating
the
progression
of
ILDs
.

Lung

This

Non

(

)
is
an
established
metastases
suppressor
in
multiple
human

types
.

However
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
NME2
action
remain
insufficiently

.

We
recently
validated
the
transcription
regulatory
activity
of
NME2
with
respect
to
control
of
proto

MYC

.

We
hypothesized
that
large
scale
transcriptional
potential
of
NME2
may
be
at
the
core
of
metastases
suppression
by
NME2
.

Using
a
combination
of
high

genomic
assays
such
as
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
coupled
to
promoter
array
hybridization
(
ChIP

)
and
gene

profiling
,
we
characterized
the
transcriptional
roles
of
NME2
.

Specifically
,
we
found
a
set
of
NME2
target
genes
which
changed
expression
upon
selective
depletion
of
NME2
in
a

The
analysis
of
gene

suggested

of

and
apoptosis
by
NME2
target
genes
which
could
be
important
in
regulation
of

PFKFB2
(

,
a
kinase
controlling

as
a
GC
response
gene
in
expression
profiling
analyses
performed
in
children
with
ALL
during

systemic
GC

.

Since
deregulation
of
glucose
metabolism
has
been
implicated
in
apoptosis
induction
,
this
gene
and
its
relatives
PFKFB1
,
3
,
and
4
were
further
analyzed
.

Expression
analyses
in
additional
ALL
children
,
non

leukemic
individuals
and
leukemic

confirmed
frequent
PFKFB2
induction
by
GC
in
most
systems
sensitive
to
GC
-
induced
apoptosis
,
particularly
in
T
-
ALL

.

The
3
other
family
members
,
in
contrast
,
were
not
or
weakly
expressed
(
PFKFB1
and
4
)
or
not
induced
by
GC
(
PFKFB3
)
.

Conditional
PFKFB2
over
-
expression
in
the
CCRF

CEM
T

ALL

model
revealed
that
its
2
splice
variants
(
15A
and
15B
)
did
not
have
any
detectable
effect
on
survival
or
cell

.

Moreover
,
neither
PFKFB2
splice
variant
significantly
affected
sensitivity
to
,
or
kinetics
of
,
GC

apoptosis
.

Our
data
suggest
that
,
at
least
in
the
model
system
investigated
,
PFKFB2
is
not
an
essential
upstream
regulator
of
the

Since
there
are
no

,
surgery
and/or
radiation
are
the
only
therapeutic
options
.

  
To
identify
dysregulated
genes
and/or
pathways
that
may
play
a
role
in
tumorigenesis
and/
or
progression
,
molecular
profiling
was
performed
on
14
gonadotrope
tumors
and
9
normal
human
pituitaries
from
autopsy
samples
.

 
Principle
component
analysis
(
PCA
)
revealed
clear
discrimination
between
tumor
and
normal
pituitary
gene
expression
profiles
.

Bioinformatic
analysis
identified
specific
genes
and
pathways
that
were
highly
differentially
regulated
,
including
a
cohort
of
putative
downstream
effectors
of
p53
were
repressed
in

pituitary
tumors
,
including
GADD45
_
,
GADD45
_
and
Reprimo
with
concomitant
downregulation
of
the
upstream
regulator
,
PLAGL1
.

 
PLAGL1
reexpression
in
gonadotrope
cells
did
not
directly
modulate
the
downstream
targets
.

Further
functional
analysis
of
GADD45
_
was
performed
.

Overexpression
of
GADD45
_
 
in
mouse
gonadotrope
cells
blocked
proliferation
,
increased
rates
of
apoptosis
in
response
to
growth
factor
withdrawal
and
increased
colony
formation
in
soft
agar
.

In
contrast
to
prior
studies
with
GADD45
_
,
methylation
interference
assays
showed
no
evidence
of
epigenetic
modification
of
the
GADD45
_
promoter
in
pituitary
tumors
.

Thus
,
our
data
suggest
that
many
components
downstream
of
p53
are
suppressed
in
gonadotrope
pituitary
tumors
.

A
novel
candidate
,
GADD45
_
is
low
in
tumors
and
reexpression
blocks
proliferation
,
survival
and
tumorigenesis
in
gonadotrope
cells
.

Unlike
GADD45
_
,
GADD45
_
is
not
methylated
to
block
its
expression
.

Together
these
studies
identify
new
targets
and
mechanisms
to
explore
concerning
pituitary
tumor
initiation
and
progression
.

To
elucidate
mechanisms
involved
in

we
performed

Aberrant
TGFbeta

is
a
hallmark
of

.

Signalling
patterns
can
depend

particularly
the

,
alter
the

We
used
microarrays
to
detail
the
programme
of

underlying
TGFbeta

We
sought

To

levels
are
necessary
to
decipher
the
epigenetic
events
involved
in
glioblastoma
aggressive

,
and
to
guide
new

In
that
purpose
,
we
performed
a
whole
genome
integrative
analysis
of
the
methylation
and
expression
profiles
for
40
newly
diagnosed
glioblastoma
patients
.

We
have
also

for
associations
between
CpG

levels
and
overall
survival
in
a
cohort
of
50
patients
uniformly
treated
with
radiotherapy
and
chemotherapy
with
concomitant
and
adjuvant
temozolomide
(

protocol
)
.

 
The
methylation
analysis
identified
616
CpG
sites
differentially
methylated
between
glioblastoma
and
control
brain
,
a
quarter
being
differentially
expressed
in
a
concordant
way
.

Among
these
concordant
CpG
sites
,
13
genes
displayed
,
within
our
glioblastoma
cohort
,
an
inverse
correlation
between
promoter
methylation
and
expression
levels
:
B3GNT5
,
FABP7
,
ZNF217
,

,
GSTM5
,
ME1
,
UBXD3
,
TSPYL5
,
FAAH
,
C7orf13
,
and
C3orf14
.

The
expression
of
these
genes
may
be
tightly
regulated
by
epigenetic
mechanisms
.

  

The
survival
analysis
identified
six
CpG
sites
associated
with
overall
survival
.

The

stratifies
the

criteria
(

.

The

40
glioblastoma

6
control

samples
were
analysed
.

2
distinct
series
of
hybridizations
were
carried
out

each
containing
GBMs

The

,
was
implemented
for
the
analysis
of

geldanamycin
.

Control
and
treated
samples
were
assayed
with
Affymetrix
HG_U133_plus_2
arrays
and
analyzed
using
LPIA
.

LPIA
looks
for
statistically
sign–Æcant
evidence
of
dysregulation
in
a
network
of
pathways
constructed
in
a
manner
that
explicitly
links
pathways
through
their
common
function
in
the
cell
.

Geldanamycin
(
geld
)
is
known
to
inhibit
the
molecular
chaperone
protein
,
Hsp90
,
and
plays
a
role
in
preventing
the
malignant
transformation
and
proliferation
of
healthy
cells
during
oncogenesis
.

LPIA
successfully
identified
pathways
specific
to
geldanamycin
effects
at
the
gene
transcription
level
.

A549
lung
carcinoma
cells
were
allowed
to
adhere
for
24h
and
further
incubated
in
the
presence
of
geldanamycin
at
a
concentration
equivalent
to
the

also
revealed
for

Triple
negative
breast
cancer
(
TNBC
)
is
histologically
characterized
by
the
absence
of
the
hormone
receptors
estrogen
and
progesterone
,
in
addition
to
having
a
negative
immunostain
for
HER-2
.

 
The
aggressiveness
of
this
disease
and
lack
of
targeted
therapeutic
options
for
treatment
is
of
high
clinical
importance
.

 
MicroRNAs
are
short
21-
to
23
nucleotide
endogenous
non
-
coding
RNAs
that
regulate
gene
expression
by
binding
to
mRNA
transcripts
,
resulting
in
either
decreased
protein
translation
or
mRNA
degradation
.

 
Dysregulated
expression
of
miRNAs
is
now
a
hallmark
of
many
human
cancers
.

 
In
order
to
identify
a
miRNA
/
mRNA
interaction
that
is
biologically
relevant
to
the
triple
negative
breast
cancer
genotype
/
phenotype
,
we
initially
conducted
a
miRNA
profiling
experiment
to
detect
differentially
expressed
miRNAs
in
cell
line
models
representing
the
triple
negative
(
MDA
-
MB-231
)
,
ER+
(
MCF7
)
,
and
HER-2
overexpressed
(
SK
-
BR-3
)
histotypes
.

 
We
identified
human
miR-34a
expression
as
being
 
>
3
-
fold
down
(
from
its
median
expression
value
across
all
cell
lines
)
in
MDA
-
MB-231
cells
,
and
identified
AXL
as
a
putative
mRNA
target
using
multiple
miRNA
/
target
prediction
algorithms
.

 
The
miR-34a
/
AXL
interaction
was
functionally
characterized
through
ectopic
overexpression
experiments
with
a
miR-34a
mimic
.

 
In
reporter
assays
,
miR-34a
binds
to
the
putative
target
site
within
the
AXL
3–≤–Ç
‚Ñ¢
UTR
to
affect
luciferase
expression
.

 
We
also
observed
degradation
of
AXL
mRNA
and
decreased
AXL
protein
levels
,
as
well
as
cell
signaling
effects
on
AKT
phosphorylation
and
phenotypic
effects
on
cell
migration
.

 
Finally
,
we
present
an
inverse
correlative
trend
in
miR-34a
and
AXL
expression
for
both
cell
line
and
patient
tumor
samples
.

The
host
antitumor
immunity
changes
drastically
during
carcinogenesis
.

Intraductal
papillary
-
mucinous
neoplasm
(
IPMN
)
of
the
pancreas
is
a
precursor
lesion
of
pancreatic
cancer
and
progresses
according
to
adenoma
-
carcinoma
sequence
.

We
found
that
the
host
antitumor
immune
reaction
changes
from
an
immune
response
to
immune
tolerance
between
intraductal
papillary
-
mucinous
adenoma
(
IPMA
)
and
intraductal
papillary
-
mucinous
carcinoma
(
IPMC
)
.

In
order
to
determine
molecules
affecting
intraepithelial
DC
infiltration
in
IPMNs
during
multistep
carcinogenesis
,
we
examined
the
gene
-
expression
profiles
of
entire
transcripts
of
neoplastic
cells
at
different
stages
.

We
collected
normal
and
neoplastic
epithelial
cells
from
frozen
tissue
sections
(
normal
main
pancreatic
duct
,
IPMA
,
IPMC
,
and
invasive
carcinoma
originating
in
IPMN
)
by
laser
microdissection
,
extracted
total
RNA
from
them
,
and
analyzed
their
gene
expression
profiles
using
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

A
major
limitation
in
the
cancer
treatment
is
the
ability
of
cancer
cells
to
become
resistant
to
chemotherapeutic
drugs
,
by
multidrug
establishment
.

Here
,
we
evaluate
the
possibility
to
utilize
MC70
,
either
as
ABC
transporters
inhibitor
or
as
anticancer
agent
,
in
monotherapy
or
in
combination
with
doxorubicin
for
cancer
treatment
.

 
The
study
was
carried
out
in
MCF7
/
ADR
and
Caco-2
,
breast
and
colon
cancer
cells
,
respectively
.

Cell
growth
and
apoptosis
were
measured
by
MTT
assay
and
DNA
laddering
Elisa
kit
,
respectively
.

Cell
cycle
perturbation
and
cellular
targets
modulation
were
analyzed
by
flow
cytometry
and
western
blotting
,
respectively
.

MC70
was
analyzed
for
its
interaction
with
ABC
transporters
,
MDR-1
,
BCRP
and
MRP-1
,
and
for
its
anticancer
activity
.

 
In
MCF7
/
ADR
,
MC70
slight
inhibited
cell
proliferation
and
strongly
enhanced
doxorubicin
effectiveness
;
conversely
in
Caco-2
,
it
inhibited
cell
growth
without
affecting
doxorubicin
efficacy
.

In
addition
,
it
induced
apoptosis
,
canceled
in
favor
of
necrosis
when
it
was
given
in
combination
with
high
doses
of
the
anthracycline
.

Moreover
,
MC70
inhibited
cell
migration
probably
through
its
residual
activity
as
sigma-1
ligand
.

Among
the
hypothesized
molecular
and
cellular
mechanisms
responsible
for
all
these
effects
,
modulations
of
cell
cycle
,
of
pAkt
and
of
the
three
MAPKs
phosphorylation
were
evidenced
while
activity
at
transcription
level
was
excluded
.

MC70
can
be
considered
as
a
potential
new
anticancer
agent
with
the
capability
to
enhance
doxorubicin
effectiveness
and
an
interesting
role
in
the
treatment
of
chemotherapy
resistant
tumors
.

The
study
included
the
basic
characterization
of
MC70
efficacy
as
inhibitor
of
MDR
transporters
,
the
investigation
of
its
anticancer
behavior
and
the
exploration
of
the
molecular
and
cellular
mechanisms
responsible
for
it

We
aimed
to
identify
specific
biomarkers
of
IFN
-
beta
bioactivity
in
order
to
compare
their
gene
expression
induction
by
type
I
IFNs
with
the
MxA
,
and
to
investigate
their
potential
role
in
MS
pathogenesis
.

Gene
expression
microarrays
were
performed
in
PBMC
from
MS
patients
who
developed
neutralizing
antibodies
(
NAB
)
to
IFN
-
beta
.

Nine
genes
followed
patterns
in
gene
expression
over
time
similar
to
the
MX1
and
were
selected
for
further
experiments
:
IFI6
,
IFI27
,
IFI44L
,
IFIT1
,
HERC5
,
LY6E
,
RSAD2
,
SIGLEC1
,
and
USP18
.

In
vitro
experiments
revealed
specific
induction
of
selected
biomarkers
by
IFN
-
beta
but
not
IFN
-
gamma
,
and
several
markers
,
in
particular
USP18
and
HERC5
,
were
significantly
induced
at
lower
IFN
-
beta
concentrations
and
more
selective
than
the
MX1
as
biomarkers
of
IFN
-
beta
bioactivity
.

In
addition
,
USP18
expression
was
deficient
in
MS
patients
compared
with
healthy
controls
(
p=0.0004
)
.

We
propose
specific
biomarkers
that
may
be
considered
in
addition
to
the
MxA
to
evaluate
IFN
-
beta
bioactivity
,
and
to
further
explore
their
implication
in
MS
pathogenesis
.

Number
of
samples
:
32
.

We
analyzed
PBMC
from
8
patients
at

and
after

and
24

Understanding
the
molecular
underpinnings
of
chemoresistance
is
vital
to
design
therapies
to
restore
chemosensitivity
.

In
particular
,
metadherin
(
MTDH
)
has
been
demonstrated
to
have
a
critical
role
in
chemoresistance
.

Over
-
expression
of
MTDH
has
recently
been
implicated
in
poor
clinical
outcome
in
breast
cancer
,
neroblastoma
,
hepatocellular
carcinoma
and
prostate
cancer
.

In
this
present
study
,
we
focused
on
the
therapeutic
benefit
of
MTDH
depletion
to
restore
sensitivity
to
cell
death
mediated
by
a
combinatorial
therapy
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
-
alpha
-
related
apoptosis
-
inducing
ligand
(
TRAIL
)
,
which
promotes
death
of
cancerous
cells
of
the
human
reproductive
tract
,
and
histone
deacetylase
(
HDAC
)
inhibitors
,
which
have
been
shown
to
increase
sensitivity
of
cancer
cells
to
TRAIL
-
induced
apoptosis
.

Our
data
indicate
that
depletion
of
MTDH
in
endometrial
cancer
cells
results
in
sensitization
of
cells
that
were
previously
resistant
to
cell
death
mediated
by
combinatorial
treatment
with
TRAIL
and
HDAC
inhibitor
LBH589
.

MTDH
was
found
to
be
involved
in
G2
/
M
checkpoint
regulation
in
response
to
LBH589
alone
or
LBH589
in
combination
with
TRAIL
,
suggesting
that
MTDH
functions
at
the
cell
cycle
checkpoint
to
accomplish
resistance
.

Using
microarray
technology
,
we
identified
57
downstream
target
genes
of
MTDH
,
including
Calbindin
1
and
Galectin
1
,
which
may
contribute
to
MTDH
-
mediated
resistance
to
combinatorial
TRAIL
and
HDAC
inhibitor
targeted
therapy
.

Inhibition
of
PDK1,AKT
phosphorylation
and
increase
Bim
expression
and
XIAP
degradation
may
result
in
sensitivity
to
cell
death
induction
in
MTDH
depleted
Hec50co
cells
by
TRAIL
and
LBH
589
combination
treatment
.

These
findings
indicate
that
depletion
of
MTDH
is
a
potentially
novel
avenue
for
effective
cancer
therapy
.

The
microarray
was
performed
on
three
biological
triplicates
as
well
as
three
experimental
triplictes
of
stable
knockdown
and
control
cells
.

 
MTDH
was
knocked
down
using
a
shRNA
.

Background
:
We
hypothesize
that
important
genomic
differences
between
breast
cancer
subtypes
occur
early
in
carcinogenesis
.

Therefore
,
gene
expression
might
distinguish
histologically
normal
breast
epithelium
(
NlEpi
)
from
breasts
containing
estrogen
receptor
positive
(
ER+
)
compared
with
estrogen
receptor
negative
(
ER-
)
cancers
.

Methods
:
We
examined
gene
expression
in
46
cases
of
microdissected
NlEpi
from
previously
untreated
women
undergoing
breast
cancer
surgery
.

From
30
age
-
matched
cases
(
15
ER+
,
15
ER-
)
we
used
Affymetryix
U133A
arrays
.

From
16
independent
cases
(
9ER+
,
7
ER-
)
,
we
validated
seven
selected
genes
using
qPCR
.

We
then
compared
gene
expression
between
NlEpi
and
invasive
breast
cancer
using
4
publicly
available
datasets
.

Results
:
216
probes
(
corresponding
to
198
unique
genes
)
distinguished
the
NlEpi
from
breasts
with
ER+
(
NlEpiER+
)
compared
to
ER-
cancers
(
NlEpiER-
)
.

These
include
genes
characteristic
of
ER+
and
ER-
cancers
themselves
,
(
e.g.
,
ESR1
,
GATA3
,
and
CX3CL1
,
FABP7
,
respectively
)
.

QPCR
validated
the
microarray
results
in
both
a
sampling
of
the
30
original
cases
(
84
%
)
and
all
of
the
16
independent
cases
(
77
%
)
.

Gene
expression
in
NlEpiER+
and
NlEPIERNlEpiER-
resembled
gene
expression
in
ER+
and
ER-
cancers
,
respectively
:
36%-53
%
of
the
genes
or
probes
examined
in
each
the
4
external
datasets
overlapped
between
NlEpi
and
the
corresponding
cancer
subtype
.

Conclusions
:
Gene
expression
differs
in
NlEpi
of
breasts
containing
ER+
compared
to
ER-
breast
cancers
.

 
These
differences
echo
differences
in
ER+
and
ER-
invasive
cancers
.

Thus
,
breast
cancer
subtypes
may
be
detectable
before
histologic
abnormalities
.

NlEpi
gene
expression
may
help
define
subtype
-
specific
risk
signatures
,
identify
initial
subtype
specific
genomic
differences
,
and
suggest
new
targets
for
subtype
-
specific
prevention
and
therapy
.

 
We
determined
that
216
probesets
significantly
differed
between
histologically
normal
epithelium
from
ER+
breast
cancer
patients
and
from
ER-
breast
cancer
patients
,
and
that
gene
expression
in
each
type
of
histologically
normal
epithelium
resembles
expression
of
the
corresponding
subtype
of
invasive
breast
cancer
(
i.e.
,
ER+
or
ER-
)
.

These
findings
suggest
that
characteristic
features
of
breast
cancer
subtypes
are
detectable
prior
to
any
histologic
abnormality
.

This
suggestion
has
implications
for
understanding
breast
cancer
biology
and
devising
new
tools
for
assessing
breast
cancer
risk
.

30
total
laser
capture
microdissected
histologically
normal
breast
tissue
samples
were
analyzed
with
Affymetrix
HU133A
microarrays
.

All
samples
were
age
-
matched
between
histologically
normal
epithelial
samples
from
ER+
breast
cancer
patients
(
n=15
)
and
histologically
normal
epithelial
samples
from
ER-
breast
cancer
patients
(
n=15
)
.

Sample
numbers
correspond
to
individual
patient
samples
.

 
Of
the
4
publicly
available
datasets
mentioned
above
,
the
only
dataset
with
a
GEO
number
was
GSE3494
,
corresponding
to
the
Miller
dataset
.

 
The
supplementary
file
below
lists
the
251
Samples
used
from
the
GSE3494
study
.

 
We
did
not
reanalyze
the
data
-
there
was
no
change
made
to
the
Miller
dataset
;
we
only
used
these
data
for
confirmation
of
our
own
dataset
.

The
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
sex
differences
in
human
muscle
morphology
and
function
remain
to
be
elucidated
.

The
purpose
of
the
study
was
to
detect
the
sex
differences
in
the
skeletal
muscle
transcriptome
in
both
the
resting
state
and
following
anabolic
stimuli
,
resistance
exercise
.

We
used
microarrays
to
profile
the
transcriptome
of
the
biceps
brachii
of
young
men
and

Skeletal
muscle
mitochondrial
dysfunction
is
secondary
to
T2DM
and
can
be
improved
by
long
-
term
regular
exercise
training
 
Mitochondrial
dysfunction
has
long
been
implicated
to
play
a
causative
role
in
development
of
type
2
diabetes
(
T2DM
)
.

However
,
a
growing
number
of
recent
studies
provide
data
that
mitochondrial
dysfunction
is
a
consequence
of
T2DM
development
.

The
aim
of
our
study
is
to
clarify
in
further
detail
the
causal
role
of
mitochondrial
dysfunction
in
T2DM
by
a
comprehensive
ex
vivo
analysis
of
mitochondrial
function
combined
with
global
gene
expression
analysis
in
muscle
of
pre
-
diabetic
newly
diagnosed
untreated
T2DM
subjects
and
long
-
standing
insulin
treated
T2DM
subjects
compared
with
age-
and
BMI
-
matched
controls
.

In
addition
,
we
assessed
the
impact
of
long
-
term
interval
exercise
training
on
physical
activity
performance
,
mitochondrial
function
and
glycemic
control
in
long
-
standing
insulin
-
treated
T2DM
subjects
.

 
Ex
vivo
mitochondrial
density
,
quality
and
functioning
was
comparable
between
pre
-
diabetic
subjects
and
matched
controls
,
however
,
gene
expression
analysis
showed
a
switch
from
carbohydrate
toward
lipids
as
energy
source
in
pre
-
diabetes
subjects
.

In
contrast
,
long
-
term
insulin
treated
T2DM
subjects
had
slightly
decreased
mitochondrial
density
and
ex
vivo
function
.

Expression
of
Krebs
cycle
and
OXPHOS
related
genes
were
decreased
,
indicating
a
decreased
capacity
to
use
lipids
as
an
energy
source
.

The
insulin
-
treated
T2DM
subjects
had
a
lower
physical
activity
level
than
pre
-
diabetic
and
normoglycemic
subjects
.

A
52
weeks
exercise
training
of
these
subjects
increased
submaximal
oxidative
efficiency
,
increased
in
vivo
PCr
recovery
rate
,
as
well
as
mildly
increased
in
vitro
mitochondrial
function
.

Gene
expression
of
_
-oxidation
,
Krebs
cycle
and
OXPHOS
-
related
genes
was
increased
.

 
Our
data
demonstrate
that
mitochondrial
dysfunction
is
rather
a
consequence
than
a
causative
factor
in
T2DM
development
as
it
was
only
detected
in
overt
diabetes
and
not
in
early
diabetes
.

Regular
exercise
training
stabilized
exogenous
insulin
requirement
and
improved
mitochondrial
functioning
,
fatty
acid
oxidation
and
general
physical
work
load
capacity
in
long
-
standing
insulin
-
treated
T2DM
subjects
.

As
such
,
the
present
study
shows
for
the
first
time
that
long
-
term
exercise
interventions
are
beneficial
in
this
group
of
complex
diabetes
patient
and
may
prevent
further
metabolic
deterioration
.

Insulin

treated
T2DM
subjects
before
and
after
52
weeks
of
exercise
training
(
T2DM_0
and
T2DM_52
)
,
normoglycemic
controls
(
NGT
)
and
pre
-
diabetes
subjects
(
IGT
)
and
were
selected
.

RNA
was
extracted
from
skeletal
muscle
biopsies
and
hybridized
on
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

Background
:
To
date
,
few
studies
have
systematically
characterized
microarray
gene
expression
signal
performance
with
degraded
RNA
from
formalin
-
fixed
paraffin
-
embedded
(
FFPE
)
specimens
in
comparison
to
intact
RNA
from
unfixed
fresh
-
frozen
(
FF
)
specimens
.

Methodology
:

RNA
was
extracted
and
isolated
from
paired
tumor
and
normal
samples
from
both
FFPE
and
FF
kidney
,
lung
and
colon
tissue
specimens
.

Microarray
signal
dynamics
on
both
the
raw
probe
and
probeset
level
were
evaluated
.

A
contrast
metric
was
developed
to
directly
compare
microarray
signal
derived
from
RNA
extracted
from
matched
FFPE
and
FF
specimens
.

Gene
-
level
summaries
were
then
compared
to
determine
the
degree
of
overlap
in
expression
profiles
.

Results
:
RNA
extracted
from
FFPE
material
was
more
degraded
and
fragmented
than
FF
,
resulting
in
reduced
dynamic
range
of
expression
signal
.

It
was
found
that
probe
performance
is
not
affected
uniformly
and
declines
sharply
toward
5
_
_
_
end
of
genes
.

The
most
significant
differences
in
FFPE
vs.
FF
signal
were
consistent
across
three
tissue
types
and
enriched
with
ribosomal
genes
.

Significance
:
Our
results
show
that
archived
FFPE
samples
can
be
used
to
profile
for
expression
signatures
and
assess
differential
expression
similar
to
unfixed
tissue
sources
.

This
study
provides
guidelines
for
application
of
these
methods
in
the
discovery
,
validation
,
and
clinical
application
of
microarray
expression
profiling
with
FFPE
material
.

We
used

to
detail
the

.

Three

Hypocalcemic
vitamin
D
analogs
are
appealing
molecules
to
exploit
the
immunomodulatory
actions
of
active
vitamin
D
in

.

The
functional
modulation
of
dendritic
cells
is
regarded
as
the
key
mechanism
underlying
their
ability
to
regulate
T
cell
responses
.

In
contrast
,
the
direct
actions
of
vitamin
D
and
structural
analogs
on
T
lymphocytes
remain
less
well
characterized
.

Microarray
analysis
was
performed
to
gain
insight
into
the
direct
immunomodulatory
actions
of
TX527
,
a
hypocalcemic
vitamin
D
analog
,
on
human
T

.

Gene
expression
analysis
revealed
that
TX527
regulated
a
wide
variety
of
genes
involved
in
different
aspects
of
T
cell
function
,
including
cellular
growth
and
proliferation
,
cell
death
,
cellular
development
,
cellular
movement
and

cell
signalling
and

were

and
cultured
in
the
presence
of
TX527
(
10

M
)
or
vehicle
(
ethanol
)
for
10
days
.

Expression
profiles
of

were
compared
using

We
previously
observed
reduced
graft
survival
for
kidney
transplants
having
interstitial
fibrosis
with
subclinical
inflammation
,
but
not
fibrosis
alone
,
on
1
-
year
protocol
biopsy
.

The
current
study
aimed
to
determine
whether
fibrosis
with
inflammation
at
1
year
is
associated
with
renal
functional
decline
in
a
low
-
risk
transplant
cohort
and
to
characterize
the
nature
of
the
inflammation
.

Subjects
were
living
-
donor
,
tacrolimus
/
mycophenolate
-
treated
transplant
recipients
without
overt
risk
factors
for
reduced
graft
survival
(
n=151
)
.

Transplants
with
normal
histology
(
n=86
)
or
fibrosis
alone
(
n=45
)
on
1
-
year
protocol
biopsy
had
stable
renal
function
between
1
and
5
years
,
while
those
having
fibrosis
with
inflammation
(
n=20
)
had
declining
glomerular
filtration
rate
and
reduced
graft
survival
.

Immunohistochemistry
confirmed
increased
interstitial
T
-
cells
and
macrophages
/
dendritic
cells
in
the
fibrosis
with
inflammation
group
.

Gene
expression
was
performed
on
a
subset
of
biopsies
in
each
group
and
demonstrated
increased
expression
of
transcripts
related
to
innate
and
cognate
immunity
in
transplants
having
fibrosis
with
inflammation
.

Pathway-
and
pathological
process
-
specific
analyses
of
microarray
profiles
revealed
that
,
in
fibrosis
with
inflammation
,
over
-
expressed
transcripts
were
enriched
for
potentially
damaging
immunological
activities
including
Toll
-
like
receptor
signaling
,
antigen
presentation
/
dendritic
cell
maturation
,
interferon
gamma
-
inducible
response
,
cytotoxic
T
lymphocyte
-
associated
and
acute
rejection
-
associated
genes
.

Thus
,
fibrosis
with
inflammation
in
1
-
year
protocol
biopsies
is
associated
with
reduced
graft
survival
and
function
and
with
a
rejection
-
like
gene
expression
signature
even
in
recipients
with
no
clinical
risk
for
inferior
outcome
.

Early
interventions
aimed
at
altering
rejection
-
like
inflammation
may
favor
improved
long
-
term
KTx
survival
.

We
analyzed
gene
expression
from
a
group
of
65
renal
transplant
recipients
.

Patient
groups
were
carefully
selected
to
include
patients
on
the
same
immunosuppression
(
Prograf
-
MMF
-
Pred
)
,
transplant
type
(
LD
)
,
absence
of
over
post
-
transplant
complications
(
AR
,
BK
,
DGF
)
.

 
For
each
patient
a
1
year
protocol
biopsy
was
examined
by
conventional
histology
and
gene
expression
.

 
By
histology
the
patients
were
categorized
as
histologically

Protein
tyrosine
phosphatase
nonreceptor
type
22
(
PTPN22
)
gene
segregates
with
most
autoimmune
diseases
;
its
risk
allele
encodes
overactive
PTPN22
phosphatases
that
alter
B
cell
receptor
(
BCR
)
signaling
potentially
involved
in
the
regulation
of
central
B
cell
tolerance
.

 
To
assess
whether
PTPN22
risk
allele
affects
the
removal
of
developing
autoreactive
B
cells
,
we
tested
by
ELISA
the
reactivity
of
recombinant
antibodies
isolated
from
single
B
cells
from
asymptomatic
healthy
individuals
carrying
one
or
two
PTPN22
risk
allele(s
)
.

We
found
that
new
emigrant
/
transitional
and
mature
naive
B
cells
from
PTPN22
risk
allele
carriers
contained
high
frequencies
of
autoreactive
clones
compared
to
non
-
carrier
control
donors
.

 
Hence
,
a
single
PTPN22
risk
allele
has
a
dominant
effect
on
altering
autoreactive
B
cell
counterselection
,
suggesting
that
early
B
cell
tolerance
checkpoint
defects
precede
the
onset
of
autoimmunity
.

 
In
addition
,
gene
array
experiments
comparing
mature
na‚Ä¢ve
B
cells
from
healthy
individuals
carrying
or
not
PTPN22
risk
allele(s
)
revealed
that
the
strength
of
association
of
PTPN22
for
autoimmunity
,
second
in
importance
only
to
the
MHC
,
may
not
only
be
due
to
BCR
signaling
alteration
but
also
to
the
regulation
of
other
genes
,
which
themselves
have
also
been
identified
as
involved
in
the
development
of
autoimmune
diseases
.

 
The
PTPN22
risk
allele
is
a
single
nucleotide
change
(
cytidine
to
thymidine
)
at
residue
1858
,
which
results
in
a
single
amino
acid
substitution
from
arginine
to
tryptophan
at
position
620
of
the
PTPN22
/
Lyp
protein
.

were

on

PURPOSE

The
development
of
reliable
gene
expression
profiling
technology
is
having
an
increasing
impact
on
our
understanding
of

biology
.

The

to
determine
whether
the

of
lung
cancer
are
correlated
.

PATIENTS
AND
METHODS

In
this
study
,
microarray
analysis
was
performed
in
a
set
of
91
non
-
small
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
samples
in
order
to
:
establish
gene
signatures
in
primary
adenocarcinomas
and
squamous
-
cell
carcinomas
;
determine
differentially
expressed
gene
sequences
at
different
stages
of
the
disease
;
and
identify
sequences
with
biological
significance
for
tumor
progression
.

After
microarray
analysis
,
the
expression
level
of
92
selected
genes
was
validated
by
qPCR
in
an
independent
set
of
70
samples
.

RESULTS
Gene
sequences
were
differentially
expressed
as
a
function
of
tumor
type
,
stage
,
and
differentiation
grade
.

High
upregulation
was
observed
for
KRT15
and
PKP1
,
which
may
be
good
markers
to
distinguish
squamous
cell
carcinoma
samples
.

High
downregulation
was
observed
for
DSG3
in
stage
IA
adenocarcinomas
.

CONCLUSION
Expression
signatures
in
NSCLC
distinguish
tumor
type
,
stage
,
and
differentiation
grade
.

the
associated
peripheral

necessitating
development
of
more

for

.

Previously
,
we
have

that

To
address
the
potential
variance
introduced
by
heterogeneity
in
responsiveness
of
PBMCs
from
different
donors
,
we
evaluated
human
leukemia

as
surrogates
for

compared
to

For
each
of
the

,
we

(
three

BACKGROUND
:
Young
age
at
portoenterostomy
has
been
linked
to
improved
outcome
in
biliary
atresia
,
but
pre
-
existing
biological
factors
may
influence
the
rate
of
disease
progression
.

In
this
study
,
we
aimed
to
determine
whether
molecular
profiling
of
the
liver
identifies
stages
of
disease
at
diagnosis
.

METHODS
:

We
examined
liver
biopsies
from
47
infants
with
biliary
atresia
enrolled
in
a
prospective
observational
study
.

Biopsies
were
scored
for
inflammation
and
fibrosis
,
used
for
gene
expression
profiles
,
and
tested
for
association
with
indicators
of
disease
severity
,
response
to
surgery
,
and
survival
at
2
years
.

RESULTS
:

Fourteen
of
47
livers
displayed
prominent
features
of
inflammation
(
N=9
)
or
fibrosis
(
N=5
)
,
with
the
remainder
showing
similar
levels
of
both
simultaneously
.

Differential
profiling
of
gene
expression
of
the
14
livers
displayed
a
unique
molecular
signature
containing
150
gene
probes
.

Applying
prediction
analysis
models
,
the
probes
classified
29
of
the
remaining
33
livers
into
inflammation
or
fibrosis
.

Molecular
classification
into
the
two
groups
was
validated
by
the
findings
of
increased
hepatic
population
of
lymphocyte
subsets
or
tissue
accumulation
of
matrix
substrates
.

The
groups
had
no
association
with
traditional
markers
of
liver
injury
or
function
,
response
to
surgery
,
or
complications
of
cirrhosis
.

However
,
infants
with
an
inflammation
signature
were
younger
,
while
those
with
a
fibrosis
signature
had
decreased
transplant
-
free
survival
.

CONCLUSION
:

Molecular
profiling
at
diagnosis
of
biliary
atresia
uncovers
a
signature
of
inflammation
or
fibrosis
in
most
livers
.

This
signature
may
relate
to
staging
of
disease
at
diagnosis
and
has
implications
to
clinical
outcomes
.

Clinical
and
laboratory
data
and
liver
biopies
were
obtained
from
47
infants
at
diagnosis
of
biliary
atresia
and
every
3
-
6
month
intervals
until
2
years
of
age
as
part
of
a
prospective
,
observational
study
of
the
Biliary
Atresia
Research
Consortium
.

Liver
biopsies
underwent
histological
scoring
and
those
specimens
classified
as
inflammation
or
fibrosis
were
used
to
generate
a
group
-
specific
gene
expression
profile
.

The
profile
was
used
to
assign
a
molecular
stages
of
inflammation
or
fibrosis
to
the
entire
cohort
.

Molecular
groups
were
tested
for
biological
plausibility
using
immunostaining
to
quantify
hepatic
inflammatory
cells
,
and
quantitative
PCR
to
reproduce
the
expression
of
gene
groups
and
the
expression
of
collagen
genes
.

They
were
also
tested
for
clinical
relevance
by
testing
of
association
with
indicators
of
liver
function
,
complications
of
disease
,
and
clinical
outcome
.

we
performed

The

a
novel
tumor
invasive

obtained
from
an
organotypic

model
of

.

This
tumor
invasive
signature
classifies
with
human
ESCC
microarrays
,
underscoring
its
utility
in
human
cancer
.

Genetic
modulation
of
periostin
promotes
tumor
cell
migration
and
invasion
as
revealed
in
gain
of
and
loss
of
function
experiments
.

Inhibition
of
EGFR
signaling
and
restoration
of
wild

type
p53
function
were
each
found
to
attenuate
periostin
,
suggesting
interdependence
of
two
common
genetic
alterations
with
periostin
function
.

Our
studies
reveal
periostin
as
an
important
mediator
of
ESCC
tumor
invasion
and
they
indicate
that
organotypic
(
3D
)
culture
can
offer
an
important
tool
to
discover
novel
biologic
effectors
in
cancer
.

Invading

invading
genetically
engineered
human
esophageal
cells
with
hTERT
and
EGFR

were
excised
using

.

RNA
was
isolated
and
amplified
for
Affymetrix
U133
microarrays
.

Subsequent
microarray
analysis
&
comparison
with
2
independent
cohorts
of
primary
ESCC
tumors
revealed
upregulation
of
periostin
as
gene
with

.

Results
:
five
patients
in
Group

Chronic
infections
by
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV
)
and
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
appear
to
be
the
most
significant
causes
of
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
.

Aberrant
promoter
methylation
is
known
to
be
deeply
involved
in
cancer
,
including
HCC
.

In
this
study
,
we
analyzed
aberrant
promoter
methylation
on
genome
-
wide
scale
in
6
HCCs
including
3
HBV
-
related
and
3
HCV
-

HCCs
,
6
matched
noncancerous
liver
tissues
and
3
normal
liver
tissues
by
methylated
DNA
immunoprecipitation
-
on
-
chip
analysis
.

Candidate
genes
with
promoter
methylation
were
detected
more
frequently
in
HCV
-
related
HCC
.

Candidate
genes
methylated
preferentially
to
HBV
-
related
or
HCV
-
related
HCCs
were
detected
and
selected
,
and
methylation
levels
of
the
selected
genes
were
validated
using
125
liver
tissue
samples
,
including
61
HCCs
(
28
HBV
-
related
HCCs
and
33
HCV
-
related
HCCs
)
and
matched
59
matched
noncancerous
livers
,
and
5
normal
livers
,
by
quantitative
methylation
analysis
using
MALDI
-
TOF
mass

.

Among
analyzed
genes
,
preferential
methylation
in
HBV
-
related
HCC
was
validated
in
1
gene
only
.

However
,
15
genes
were
found
methylated
preferentially
in
HCV
-
related
HCC
,
which
was
independent
from
age
.

Hierarchical
clustering
of
HCC
using
these
15
genes
stratified
HCV
-
related
HCC
as
a
cluster
of
frequently
methylated
samples
.

The
15
genes
included
genes
inhibitory
to
cancer
-
related
signaling
such
as
RAS
/
RAF
/
ERK
and
Wnt
/
b
-
catenin
pathways
.

It
was
indicated
that
genes
methylated
preferentially
in
HCV
-
related
HCC
exist
,
and
it
was
suggested
that
DNA
methylation
might
play
an
important
role
in
HCV
-
related
HCC
by
silencing
cancer
-
related
pathway
inhibitors
.

we
analyzed
aberrant
promoter
methylation
in
6
HCC
clinical
samples
(
including
3
HBV
-
related
HCCs
and
3
HCV
-
related
HCCs
)
and
their
matched
noncancerous
tissues
on
genome
-
wide
scale
by
the
method
.

Candidate
regions
of
promoter
methylation
preferentially
to
HBV
-
related
HCC
and
HCV
-
related
HCC
were
selected
,
and
the
methylation
levels
of
these
genes
were
measured
quantitatively
using
MALDI
-
TOF
mass
spectrometry
.

Expression
levels
of
these
6
pairs
of
HCC
and
4
more
pairs
of
HCCs
and
surrounding
noncancerous

Neutrophil
lysis
after
phagocytosis
is
a
process
potentially
important
in
the
pathogenesis
of
community
-
associated
methicillin
-
resistant
S.
aureus
(
CA
-
MRSA
)
infection
.

 
The
mechanism
for
this
process
is
not
currently
known
.

 
Therefore
,
to
better
understand
CA
-
MRSA
virulence
we
used
human
oligonucleotide
microarrays
to
investigate
the
mechanism
underlying
enhanced
PMN
lysis
that
occurs
after
phagocytosis
of
CA
-
MRSA
.

In
order
to
examine
the
effect
of
S.
aureus
on
the
neutrophil
transcriptome
and
to
elucidate
any
possible
differences
in
this
effect
between
hospital-
and
community
-
associated
S.
aureus
,
we
performed
microarray
expression
analysis
on
human
neutrophils
treated
with
hospital-
and
community
-
associated
S.
aureus
.

Polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
(
PMNs
)
were
isolated
from
the
blood
of
healthy
donors
.

 
Control
and
S.

exposed
PMNs
were
incubated
at
37C
for

Islet
transplantation
exposes
beta
cells
to
mild
hyperglycemia
and
to
the
abnormal
environment
of
the
transplant
site
.

These
conditions
may
affect
beta
cells
and
induce
the
expression
of
genes
involved
in
beta
cell
damage
.

Gene
expression
profile
of
human
beta
cells
exposed
to
mild
hyperglycemia
by
transplantation
into
ICR
-
SCID
mice
was
evaluated
and
compared
with
the
gene
profile
of
beta
cells
obtained
from
non
-
diabetic
subjects
.

We
found
that
the
transplanted
beta
cells
showed
an
unfolded
protein
response
(
UPR
)
.

There
was
upregulation
of
many
genes
of
the
IRE-1
pathway
that
provide
protection
against
the
deleterious
effects
of
ER
stress
.

Among
them
,
increased
expression
of
genes
coding
XBP-1
;
the
chaperone
proteins
PDIA4
,
Bip
,
and
Grp94
;
and
the
ER
degradation
proteins
EDEM1
and
EDEM2
.
ERdj4
and
DNA
-
JC3
were
also
upregulated
.

JUK
had
downregulated
expression
.

The
PERK
and
ATF-6
arms
of
the
ER
stress
response
had
many
downregulated
genes
in
transplanted
islets
.

The
PERK
's
substrates
,
EIF2A
and
NRF2
,
showed
markedly
reduced
expression
,
as
downregulated
was
the
expression
of
CReP.

Other
downregulated
genes
included
HERP2
,
IRS-2
,
CHOP
and
C
/
EBP
-
beta
.

In
the
transplanted
beta
cells
there
was
significantly
decreased
expression
of
ATF-6
,
as
well
as
the
downstream
gene
products
CHOP
and
HERP2
.

There
was
increased
expression
of
HRD1
,
which
exerts
an
antiapoptotic
effect
by
degrading
unfolded
proteins
.

In
conclusion
human
beta
cells
in
a
transplant
site
had
UPR
changes
in
gene
expression
that
protect
against
the
proapoptotic
effects
of
unfolded
proteins
.

Frozen
sections
were
obtained
from
pancreases
of
non

SCID
mice
for
4
weeks
.

_
cell

was
extracted
,
amplified
and
subjected
to
microarray
analysis
.

Fourteen
human
subjects
(
18

)
were
studied
.

The
control
group
(
saline

)
received
a
12
hour
infusion
of
saline
and
the
experimental

)
received
a
12
hour
infusion
of
cortisol
(
3
ug
/

)
.

After
6
hours
of
saline
or

infusion
,
intravenous
lipopolysaccharide
(

was
administered
to

were
isolated
from
these
blood

This
work
presents
the
discovery
of
genes
that
are
dysregulated
in
patients
with
Type

.

It
provides
insight
into
the
unique
pathogenesis
of
these
phenotypes
,
improved
diagnostic
accuracy
and
potential
novel

for
these

obtained
under
a

We
investigated
the
ability
of
HDAC
inhibitors
(
HDACi
)
to
target
CML
stem
cells
.

Treatment
with
HDACi
combined
with
IM
effectively
induced
apoptosis
in
quiescent
CML
progenitors
resistant
to
elimination
by
IM
alone
,
and
eliminated
CML
stem
cells
capable
of
engrafting
immunodeficient
mice
.

In
vivo
administration
of
HDACi
with
IM
markedly
diminished
LSC
in
a
transgenic
mouse
model
of
CML
.

The
interaction
of
IM
and
HDACi
inhibited

at
a
concentration
of
1mM
for
6
hours
(

Background
:
Previous
work
has
identified
CD11c+CD1c-
dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
as
the
major
'
inflammatory
'
dermal
DC
population
in
psoriasis
vulgaris
and
CD1c+
DCs
as
the
'
resident
'
cutaneous
DC
population
.

Objective
:
 
To
further
define
molecular
differences
between
these
two
myeloid
dermal
DC
populations
.

Methods
:
Inflammatory
and
resident
DCs
were
single
-
cell
sorted
from
psoriasis
lesional
skin
biopsies
,
and
gene
array
expression
profiling
was
performed
.

 
Results
were
confirmed
with
RT
-
PCR
,
flow

,
immunohistochemistry
,
and
double
label
immunofluorescence
.

 
Pooled
human
keratinocytes
were
cultured
for
functional
studies
.

  
Results
:
 
TNF

and
many
other
inflammatory
products
were
selectively
expressed
in
inflammatory
DCs
than
in
resident
DCs
.

 
Flow
cytometry
and
immunofluorescence
confirmed
higher
protein
expression
on
CD1c-
versus
CD1c+
DCs
.

 
TRAIL
receptor
,
death
receptor

,
and
in

culture
of
keratinocytes
with

TRAIL
induced
CCL20
leukocyte

.

 
Conclusion
:
 
CD11c+CD1c-
inflammatory
DCs
in
 
psoriatic
lesional
skin
express
a
wide
range
of
inflammatory
molecules
compared
to
skin
resident
CD1c+
DCs
.

 
Some
molecules
made
by
inflammatory
DCs
,
including
TRAIL
,
could
have
direct
effects
on
keratinocytes
or
other
skin
cell
types
to
promote
disease
pathogenesis
.

Shave
biopsies
were
cultured
overnight
in

.

Dermis
was
cultured
for
36
-

hours
to
 
obtain
dermal

.

These
cells
were
stained
with

This
study
investigated
the
global
effect
of
carbon
monoxide
(
CO
)
gas
(
250
ppm
)
on
LPS-
induced
gene
expression
in
THP-1
cells
.

CO
predominantly
suppresses
LPS
-
induced
gene
response
.

Of
the
CO
-
suppressed
genes
,
18
%
were
transcription
factors
and
most
others
were
cytokines
,
chemokines
and
immune

genes
.

Sequence
analysis
B

siteskappafound
that
81
%
of
the
gene
promoters
have
putative

These
results
suggest
that

NF-
The
microarrays
were
performed
on
THP-1
cells
,
a
human
monocytic
cell
line
.

Cells
were
treated
with
or
without
LPS
(
1
ug
/
ml
)
in
presence
or
absence
of
carbon
monoxide
(
250
ppm
)
for
1
h.
Total
RNA
was
isolated
,
reverse
transcribed
,
labeled
and
hybridized
to
oligonucleotide
microarrays
.

Long
-
lasting
activation
of
T
cells
requires
up
-
regulation
of
many
genes
,
for
example
of
transcription
factors
,
cytoskeletal
proteins
and
cell
surface
proteins
including
ion
channels
.

An
increase
of
ion
channel
density
at
the
cell
surface
reflects
the
needs
to
manage
increased
Ca2
+
influx
into
the
activated
T
cell
.

Using
oligonucleotide
-
based
arrays
we
have
surveyed
changes
in
ion
channel
mRNA
expression
that
occur
upon
T
cell
activation
.

We
used
Affymetrix
Analysis
to
confirm
our
data
achieved
by
self
-
designed
glass
array
analysis
.

We
isolated
PBMCs
from
blood
of
healthy
donors
and
divided
those
into
two
parts
.

One
was
activated
for
72
hr
by
adding
PHA
-
L
whereas
the
other
part
was
incubated
in
the
same
way
but
not
stimulated
.

Our
understanding
of
how
mesodermal
tissue
is
formed
,
has
been
limited
by
the
absence
of
specific
and
reliable
markers
of
early
mesoderm
commitment
.

We
report
that
mesoderm
commitment
from
human
embryonic
stem
cells
(
hESC
)
is
initiated
by
Epithelial
to
Mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
as
shown
by
gene
expression
profiling
and
by
reciprocal
changes
in
expression
of
the
cell
surface
proteins
,
EpCAM
/
CD326
and
NCAM
/
CD56
.

Molecular
and
functional
assays
reveal
that
CD326negCD56
+
cells
,
generated
from
hESC
in
the
presence
of
activin
A
,
BMP4
,
VEGF
and
FGF2
,
represent
a
novel
,
multi
-
potent
mesoderm
-
committed
progenitor
population
.

CD326negCD56
+
progenitors
are
unique
in
their
ability
to
generate
all
mesodermal
lineages
including
hematopoietic
,
endothelial
,
mesenchymal
(
bone
,
cartilage
,
fat
,
fibroblast
)
,
smooth
muscle
and
cardiomyocytes
,
while
lacking
the
pluripotency
of
hESC
.

CD326negCD56
+
cells
are
the
precursors
of
previously
reported
,
more
lineage
-
restricted
mesodermal
progenitors
.

These
findings
present
a
novel
approach
to
study
how
germ
layer
specification
is
regulated
,
and
offer
a
unique
target
for
tissue
engineering
.

We
used
microarrays
to
compare
gene
expression
profile
of
early
mesodermal
progenitors
with
undifferentiated
hESC
(
H9
line
)
.

Mesoderm
induction
from
hESC
was
initiatiated
with
combination
of
morphogens
and
growth
factors
including
activin
A
,
bone
morphogenic
protein
4
,
basic
fibroblast
growth
factor
and
vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
.

Proposed
mesodermal
progenitor
population
was
isolated
by
FACS
on
day
3.5
of
culture
based
on
the
presence
of
CD56
expression
and
the
absenbce
of
CD326
expression
.

Literature
suggests
that
the
route
of
feeding
may
impact
the
immune
system
.

This
study
examines
changes
in
gene
expression
due
to
route
of
feeding
in
healthy
volunteers
.

Healthy
volunteers
were
fed
continuous
parenteral
diet
or
continuous
enteral
diet
for
72
hours
Blood
samples
were
collected
prior
to
feeding
and
72
hours
after
feeding
.

Monocytes
were
purified
using
Rosette
Sep
protocol
.

We
used
microarrays
to
identifiy
genes
with
significantly
changed
expression
.

Identification
of
the
molecular
changes
that
promote
viability
and
metastatic
behaviour
of
prostate
cancer
cells
is
critical
for
the
development
of
improved
therapeutic
interventions
for
prostate
cancer
.

Stat5a
/
b
and
Stat3
are
both
constitutively
active
in
locally
-
confined
and
advanced
prostate
cancer
,
and
both
transcription
factors
have
been
reported
to
be
critical
for
the
viability
and
growth
of
prostate
cancer
cells
.

We
used
microarrays
to
compare
gene
expression
profiles
regulated
by
Stat5a
/
b
vs.
Stat3
in
human
prostate
cancer
cells
.

DU145
and
CWR22Rv1
human
prostate
cancer
cells
were
transfected
with
Stat3
siRNA
,
Stat5a/

b
siRNA
or
scramble
siRNA
as
control
.

After
48
h
,
the
cells
were
harvested
and
total

was
prepared
for
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

The
8p11
myeloproliferative
syndrome
(
EMS
)
,
also
referred
to
as
the
stem
cell
leukemia
/
lymphoma
syndrome
,
is
a
chronic
myeloproliferative
disorder
that
rapidly
progresses
into
an
acute
leukemia
.

Molecularly
,
EMS
is
characterized
by
fusion
of
various
partner
genes
to
the
FGFR1
gene
,
resulting
in
constitutive
activation
of
the
tyrosine
kinase
activity
within
FGFR1
.

The
two
most
common
fusion
genes
in
human
EMS
are
ZMYM2
/
FGFR1
(
previously
known
as
ZNF198
/
FGFR1
)
and
BCR
/
FGFR1
.

To
study
the
transcriptional
programs
becoming
deregulated
by
the
FGFR1
fusion
genes
,
global
gene
expression
analysis
on
human
CD34
+
cord
blood
cells
expressing
either
of
the
fusion
oncogenes
ZMYM2
/
FGFR1
and
BCR
/
FGFR1
was
performed
.

As
a
reference
gene
we
also
included
the
more
studied
BCR
/
ABL1
fusion
oncogene
associated
with
chronic
myeloid
leukemia
.

We
found
that
the
3
different
fusion
oncogenes
had
in
common
the
upregulation
of
several
genes
involved
in
the
JAK
/
STAT
signalling
pathway
and
also
other
sets
of
genes
.

However
,
the
gene
expression
profiles
were
not
identical
,
suggesting
that
both
the
tyrosine
kinase
containing
gene
and
the
partner
gene
would
affect
the
transcription
of
downstream
target
genes
.

Bicistronic

Kidney
transplants
that
develop
dysfunction
or
proteinuria
after
one
year
post
transplant
are
at
considerable
risk
for
progression
to
renal
failure
.

Identifying
the
molecules
associated
with
graft
failure
could
potentially
lead
to
interventions
that
would
slow
the
progression
of
organ
failure
.

We
analyzed
the
relationship
between
gene
expression
in
late
biopsies
for
cause
in
human
kidney
transplants
and
subsequent
graft
loss
,
and
assessed
the
predictive
value
of
gene
expression
.

We
evaluated
the
performance
of
these
genes
in
an
independent
,
and
in
a
population
of
early
biopsies
that
have
a
very
low
risk
of
subsequent
graft
failure
.

All
consenting

as
standard
of

between
09/2004
and

or
between
11/2006
and

were
included
in
the
analysis
.

In
addition
,
biopsies
obtained
from
Minnesota
between
09/2006
and
09/2007
were
used
as
an
independent
.

In
addition
to
the
cores
required
for
standard
histopathology
,
we
collected
one
core
for
gene

studies
.

the
relationship
between
gene

in
the

and
subsequent
graft

was
analyzed

(
ERK1/2
and

)
are
known
to
play
important
roles
in

.

Here
we
show
roles
of
inhibition
of

,
or
ERK5
on
gene
expression
profiles
of
epithelioid
malignant

were
used
.

Microarrays
were

The
goal
of
this
study
was
to
identify
signalling

,
we
sorted
CXCR4

Three
sets
of

,
each
in

,
were
analyzed
.

These
include
CXCR4

treated
with
SDF-1

Hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV)-associated
acute
liver
failure
(
ALF
)
is
a
dramatic
clinical
syndrome
due
to
a
sudden
loss
of
hepatic
cells
leading
to
multiorgan
failure
.

The
mechanisms
whereby
HBV
induces
ALF
are
unknown
.

We
used
gene
expression
profiling
to
establish
a
molecular
definition
of
hepatitis
B
virus
(
HBV)-associated
ALF
.

Two
patients
who
underwent
liver
transplantation
for
HBV
-
associated
ALF
were
studied
.

Gene
expression
profiling
was
performed
on
8
liver
specimens
obtained
from
the
two
patients
with
ALF
(
4
samples
per
liver
)
and
individual
liver
specimens
from
8
liver
donors
and
normal
livers
from
11
patients
who
underwent
resection
for
angioma
.

Statistical
analyses
were
used
to
identify
the
signature
genes
of
HBV
-
associated
ALF
.

Multivariate
permutation
analysis
identified
1,368
transcripts
that
were
differentially
expressed
in
ALF
;
709
were
up
-
regulated
and
659
down
-
regulated
.

The
most
represented
up
-
regulated
transcripts
were
those
involved
in
the
immune
response
,
whereas
the
most
abundant
down
-
regulated
transcripts
were
those
involved
in
metabolism
and
hepatic
synthesis
.

ALF
was
characterized
by
overriding
B
-
cell
signature
comprising
genes
related
to
mature
B
cells
and
plasma
cells
with
abundant
polyclonal
expression
of
immunoglobulin
genes
.

 
By
contrast
,
there
was
a
limited
T
-
cell
signature
and
up
-
regulation
of
several
inhibitors
of
T
-
cell
activation
.

Immunohistochemical
analysis
confirmed
the
prominent
B
-
cell
signature
showing
diffuse
liver
infiltration
by
plasma
blasts
and
plasma
cells
with
strong
cytoplasmic
staining
for
IgM
and
IgG
,
associated
with
a
significant
deposition
of
complement
factors
.

Using
phage
display
technology
,
we
demonstrated
that
the
molecular
target
of
the
massive
intrahepatic
antibody
response
is
the
hepatitis
B
core
antigen
(
HBcAg
)
.

These
data
suggest
that
the
humoral
immunity
may
exert
a
primary
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
HBV
-
associated
ALF
.

Liver
samples
were
obtained
from
explanted
livers
of
two
patients
with
HBV
-
associated
ALF
(
4
samples
per
liver
)
,
8
normal
liver
donors
and
11
patients
who
underwent
resection
for
angioma
.

Gene
expression
profiling
was
used
to
establish
a
molecular
definition
of
ALF
.

(
IPF
)
is
an
untreatable
fibrotic
lung
disease
characterized
by
fibroblast
proliferation
and
epithelial

.

The
expression
and

of
microRNAs
(

has
not
been
studied
in

we
identified
46
differentially

in
IPF
lungs
which
included
let-7d

Results
from

,
however
,
the
underlying
molecular
differences
that
may
occur
at

of

have
not
been
investigated
.

 
To
test
the
hypothesis
that
the
molecular
basis
for
schizophrenia
changes
from
early
to
chronic
illness
,
we
profiled
genome
-
wide

in
prefrontal
cortex
of
schizophrenic
subjects
at
different
stages
of
illness
,
along
with
their

.

  
Results
show
that
gene
expression
profiles
change
dramatically
depending
on
the
stage
of
illness
,
whereby
the
greatest
number
and
magnitude
of
gene
expression
differences
were
detected
in
subjects
with
short

term
illness
(
–Ü
4
years
from

)
.

  
Comprehensive

analyses
revealed
that
each
defined
stage
of
illness
was
associated
with
dysfunction
in
both
distinct
,
as
well
as

systems
.

 
Short

was
particularly
associated
with
disruptions
in
gene
transcription
,
metal

,
RNA

and
vesicle

.

 
In
contrast
,
long

was
associated
with
inflammation
,

.

  
We
validated

of
12

with
these

there
was

among
all

including

Our

demonstrate
that
the

The
accumulation
of
unfolded
or
misfolded
proteins
in
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
(
ER
)
results
in
the
condition
called
–¢ER
stress–£
which
induces
the
unfolded
protein
response
(
UPR
)
which
is
a
complex
cellular
process
that
includes
changes
in
expression
of
many
genes
.

Failure
to
restore
homeostasis
in
the
ER
is
associated
with
human
diseases
.

To
identify
the
underlying
changes
in
gene
expression
in
response
to
ER
stress
,
we
induced
ER
stress
in
human
B
-
cells
and
then
measured
gene
expression
at
10
time
-
points
.

We
followed
up
those
results
by
studying
cells
from
60
unrelated
people
.

We
rediscovered
genes
that
were
known
to
play
a
role
in
ER
stress
response
and
uncovered
several
thousand
genes
that
are
not
known
to
be
involved
.

Two
of
these
are
VLDLR
and
INHBE
which
showed
significant
increase
in
expression
following
ER
stress
in
B
-
cells
and
in
primary
fibroblasts
.

To
study
the
links
between
unfolded
protein
response
and
disease
susceptibility
,
we
identified
ER
stress
responsive
genes
that
are
associated
with
human
diseases
and
assessed
individual
differences
in
ER
stress
response
.

Many
of
the
UPR
genes
are
associated
with
Mendelian
disorders
such
as
Wolfram
syndrome
and
complex
human
diseases
including
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis
and
diabetes
.

Data
from
two
independent
samples
showed
extensive
individual
variability
in
ER
stress
response
.

Additional
analyses
with
monozygotic
twins
revealed
significant
correlations
within
twin
pairs
in
their
responses
to
ER
stress
thus
showing
evidence
for
heritable
variation
among
individuals
.

These
results
have
implications
for
basic
understanding
of
ER
function
and
its
role
in
disease
susceptibility
.

Obesity
is
a

however
,
not

of
this

was
to
identify
molecular

Numerous

in

all
originally
derived

have

we
have
made

When

Gene

has
revealed
a

are
particularly
predominant
in

,
whereas

Altered
levels
of
MOF
(
member
of
MYST
family
histone
acetyl
transferase
)
and
decreased
levels
of
H4K16ac
correlate
with
a
defective
DNA
damage
response
(
DDR
)
.

The
human
MOF
gene
encodes
a
protein
that
specifically
acetylates
histone
H4
at
lysine
16
(
H4K16ac
)
.

Here
we
show
that
altered
levels
of
H4K16ac
correlate
with
a
defective
DNA
damage
response
(
DDR
)
to
ionizing
radiation
(
IR
)
.

The
defect
however
is
not
due
to
altered
expression
of
proteins
involved
in
DDR
.

Specific
inhibition
of
H4K16ac
deacetylation
in
MOF
-
depleted
cells
rescued
IR
-
induced
abrogation
of
DDR
.

MOF
was
found
associated
with
DNA
-
dependent
protein
kinase
catalytic
subunit
(
DNAPKcs
)
,
a
protein
involved
in
non
-
homologous
end
joining
(
NHEJ
)
repair
,
whose
ATMdependent
IR
-
induced
phosphorylation
was
abrogated
in
MOF
-
depleted
cells
.

Our
data
indicate
that
MOF
depletion
greatly
decreased
the
repair
of
DNA
double
-
strand
breaks
(
DSBs
)
by
NHEJ
and
homologous
recombination
(
HR
)
.

In
addition
,
the
MOF
protein
activity
associates
with
chromatin
upon
DNA
damage
and
colocalizes
with
the
synaptonemal
complex
in
male
meiocytes
.

We
propose
that
MOF
,
through
H4K16ac
,
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
cellular
DNA
damage
response
.

Aberrant
epithelial
-
mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
is
involved
in
pathological
processes
including
fibrotic
disorders
and
cancer
invasion
and
metastasis
.

Alterations
of
the
cell
-
extracellular
matrix
(
ECM
)
interaction
also
contribute
to
those
pathological
settings
.

However
,
the
functional
interplay
between
EMT
and
cell
-
ECM
interaction
is
poorly
understood
.

Here
,
we
show
that
tumor
necrosis
factor
(
TNF)-alpha
,
a
potent
mediator
of
inflammation
,
induces
EMT
-
associated
fibrosis
in
retinal
pigment
epithelial
cells
,
and
that
this
is
regulated
by
hyaluronan
(
HA)-CD44
-
Moesin
interaction
.

TNF
-
alpha
elicits
both
HA
synthesis
and
Moesin
phosphorylation
through
protein
kinase
C
activation
,
promoting
binding
of
CD44
to
the
newly
synthesized
HA
.

The
HA
-
CD44
-
Moesin
interaction
leads
to
cell
-
cell
dissociation
through
actin
remodeling
and
increased
cellular
motility
associated
with
mesenchymal
phenotype
.

Furthermore
,
we
established
an
in

model
of
TNF
-
alpha
-
induced
fibrosis
in
the
mouse
eye
,
and
the
ocular
fibrosis
was
completely
suppressed
in
CD44
-
null
mice
.

Therefore
,
HA
production
and
its
interaction
with
CD44
plays
essential
role
in
TNF
-
alpha
-
induced
-
EMT
,
and
the
interference
of
the
complex
formation
can
be
a
new
strategy
for
the
fibrotic

Embryonic

provide
,
theoretically
,
unlimited
access
to
any
needed
amount
of
any
specific
cell
phenotype
of
an

,
due
to
their
unique

at

and
pluripotency
(
Smith
2001
;

)
.

These
properties
allow
using
the
progeny
of
ES
cell

to
model
human
pathologies
(

.

In
particular
,
human

cell

derived
from
embryos
characterized
as
gene

following
pre

genetic

(

for

(
Pickering

et

;
Mateizel
,
De

)
may
be
considered
as
perfect
cellular
replicas
of
those
diseases
,
as
they
exhibit
the
exact
genotypes
associated
to
them
.

Here
,
we
confirm
this
hypothesis
by
demonstrating
that
the
cell
progeny
of
an
ES
cell
line
derived
from
an
embryo
with
myotonic
dystrophy
type
1
(
DM1
)
displayed
the
morphological
stigma
associated
to
the
expression
of
the
mutant
gene
–†so
-
called
intranuclear
foci-
as
well
as
abnormal
alternate
splicing
of
the
insulin
receptor
,
a
characteristic
feature
of
DM1
.

Further
differential
transcriptomic
analysis
of
the
DM1
gene
-
carrying
cells
with
phenotypically
similar
populations
from
native
ES
cell
lines
revealed
abnormal
expression
of
89
genes
,
among
which
48
were
down
-
regulated
and
39
over
-
expressed
.

This
study
demonstrates
that
DM1
,
though
a
disease
with
relatively
late
clinical
onset
,
is
associated
with
expression
of
genetic
defects
early
on
during
development
.

It
underlines
the
value
of
PGD
-
derived
ES
cell
lines
as
a
tool
to
decipher
molecular
mechanisms
of
genetic
diseases

The
dendritic
cell
(
DC
)
is
a
master
regulator
of
immune
responses
.

Pathogenic
viruses
subvert
normal
immune
function
in
DCs
through
the
expression
of
immune
antagonists
.

Understanding
how
these
antagonists
interact
with
the
host
immune
system
requires
knowledge
of
the
underlying
genetic
regulatory
network
that
operates
during
an
uninhibited
antiviral
response
.

In
order
to
isolate
and
identify
this
network
,
we
studied
DCs
infected
with
Newcastle
Disease
Virus
(
NDV
)
,
which
is
able
to
stimulate
innate
immunity
and
DC
maturation
through
activation
of
RIG
-
I
signaling
,
but
lacks
the
ability
to
evade
the
human
interferon
response
.

To
analyze
this
experimental
model
,
we
developed
a
new
approach
integrating
genome
-
wide
expression
kinetics
and
time
-
dependent
promoter
analysis
.

We
found
that
the
genetic
program
underlying
the
antiviral
cell
state
transition
during
the
first
18
-
hours
post
-
infection
could
be
explained
by
a
single
regulatory
network
.

Gene
expression
changes
were
driven
by
a
step
-
wise
multi
-
factor
cascading
control
mechanism
,
where
the
specific
transcription
factors
controlling
expression
changed
over
time
.

Within
this
network
,
most
individual
genes
are
regulated
by
multiple
factors
,
indicating
robustness
against
virus
-
encoded
immune
evasion
genes
.

In
addition
to
effectively
recapitulating
current
biological
knowledge
,
we
predicted
,
and
validated
experimentally
,
antiviral
roles
for
several
novel
transcription
factors
.

More
generally
,
our
results
show
how
a
genetic
program
can
be
temporally
controlled

a

achieve
the

A
gene
expression
signature
purporting
to
distinguish
between
telomerase
and
ALT
immortalization
has
recently
been
described
(
Lafferty
-
Whyte
et
al
.
,
2009
)
.

 
This
was
obtained
as
the
intersection
of
two
independent
signatures
,
one
obtained
from
cell
lines
and
the
other
from
a
panel
of
liposarcomas
,
which
utilize
different
telomere
maintenance
mechanisms
(
TMMs
)
.

  
To
assess
the
utility
of
this
signature
we
used
Affymetrix
U133plus2.0
arrays
to
undertake
a
similar
analysis
of
an
independent
collection
of
liposarcomas
of
defined
TMM
.

 
In
our
dataset
,
the
297
gene
signature
causes
the
liposarcomas
to
cluster
not
on
the
basis
of
TMM
,
but
rather
on
the
basis
of
tumor
histological
subtype
[
Figure

]
,
consistent
with
the
signatures
reported
by
others
(
Matushansky
et

)
.

  
Expression
analyses
were
performed
on
38
liposarcoma
tumors
using
Affymetrix
U133plus2.0
arrays
.

 
Using
cosine
distance
as
a

metric
,
hierarchical
clustering
of
these
samples
was
performed
according
to
the
expression
levels
of
the
297
genes
identified
in
the
study
by

Whyte
et

Senescent
is
an
irreversible
form
of

initiated

.

 
Replicative
senescence
in
vitro
can
be
considered
a
model
for
human
aging
.

 
When
fibroblasts
are
cultured
under
atmospheric
oxygen
conditions
of
20
%
,
typical
of
normal
tissue
culture
procedure
,
fibroblasts
generally
reach
their
replicative
capacity
at
50
-
60
population
doublings
(
PDs
)
.

 
When
fibroblasts
are
cultured
under
normal
physiological
oxygen
conditions
of
3
%
,
PDs
increase
about
30
%
relative
to
atmospheric
levels
.

 
Hence
while
oxygen
is
a
requirement
for
normal
aerobic
respiration
,
it
can
contribute
to
the
total
amount
of
oxidative
stress
to
which
cells
are
exposed
to
,
leading
to
a
long
-
term
adverse
effect
in
vitro
.

 
Inasmuch
,
cultures
maintained
under
hyperoxic
and
hypoxic
conditions
provide
a
convenient
model
system
for
assessing
the
relationship
between
oxygen
/
oxidative
stress
and
senescence
.

We
used
microarrays
to
profile
the
changes
in
global
gene
expression
during
aging
and

of
Imr90
cells
under
growth
oxygen
conditions
of
3

Timepoints

Distant

In
order
to
identify
genes
influencing
the
prognosis
of
patients
with
CRC
,
we
compared
gene
expression
in
primary
tumors
with
and
without
distant

using
an

.

We
also
examined
the

studied
the

As
a
result
,
we
identified
MUC12
as
a
candidate
gene
involved
in
metastasis
processes
by
microarray
analysis
.

Quantitative
real

showed
that

expression
was
significantly
lower
in

in

.

Multivariate
analysis
disclosed
that
MUC12

status
was
an
independent
prognostic
factor
in

.

  
This
study
revealed
the
prognostic
value
of
MUC12
expression
in
CRC
patients
.

Moreover
,
our
result
suggests
MUC12
expression
is
a
possible
candidate
gene
for
assessing
postoperative
adjuvant
therapy
for
CRC
patients
.

Total
of

(
77
for

,
and
17

together
with
BioConductor

Then
,
the
gene

transformed
,
and
62

were
removed
for
further

.

 
In
order
to
identify
a

,
we
performed
Wilcoxon

test
for
gene

differences
of
54,613

.

Similarly
,
Wilcoxon
singed

test
was
conducted
to
select
genes
which
showed
significant

difference
between

.

Then
,
we
selected
a

Severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
-
associated
coronavirus
(
SARS
-
CoV
)
infection
causes
an
immune
-
mediated
disease
.

We
have
recently
shown
that
SARS
-
CoV
-
induced
epithelial
Calu-3
cytokines
could
exacerbate
and
dampen
host
inflammatory
and
T
cell
responses
,
respectively
,
through
modulating
the
functions
of
macrophages
and
dendritic
cells
,
thereby
suggesting
that
not
only
are
lung
epithelial
cells
the
primary
cells
of
SARS
-
CoV
infection
,
 
but
they
also
involve
in
initiating
and
orchestrating
the
host
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
.

Comprehensive
evaluation
of
the
complex
epithelial
signaling
to
SARS
-
CoV
is
,
thus
,
crucial
for
paving
the
way
to
better
understand
SARS
pathogenesis
and
develop
the
innovative
therapeutics
against
SARS
.

Here
,
based
on
the
microarray
-
based
functional
genomics
,
we
reported
that
2B4
cells
,
a
clonal
derivative
of
Calu-3
cells
,
elicited
a
temporal
and
spatial
activation
of
nuclear
factor
(
NF)kappaB
,
activator
protein
(
AP)-1
(
ATF2
/
c
-
Jun
)
,
and
interferon
regulatory
factor
(
IRF)-3/-7
at
12-
,
24-
,
and
48
-
hrs
post
infection
(
p.i
.
)
,
respectively
,
resulting
in
the
activation
of
many
antiviral
genes
,
including
interferon
(
IFN)-
_
,
-_s
,
SARS
-
related
inflammatory
mediators
,
and
various
IFN
-
stimulated
genes
(
ISGs
)
.

While
elevated
responses
of
IFN-
_
and
IFN-_s
were
not
detected
until
48
-
hrs
p.i
.
,
as
a
consequence
of
a
delayed
IRF-3/-7
activation
,
we
showed
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
both
types
of
IFNs
exerted
previously
under
-
described
non
-
redundant
,
complementary
,
and/or
synergistic
effects
on
the
epithelial
defense
against
SARS
-
CoV.
Collectively
,
our
results
highlight
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
the
sequential
activation
of
virus-
and
IFN
-
dependent
signaling
of
lung
epithelial
cells
against
SARS
-
CoV
and
identify
novel
cellular
targets
for
future
studies
,
aiming
at
advancing
strategies
against
SARS
.

To
characterize
the
dynamic
,
spatial
,
and
temporal
changes
of
the
gene
expression
induced
by
SARS
-
CoV
,
confluent
2B4
cells
grown
in
T-75
flasks
were
infected
with
SARS
-
CoV
(
MOI=0.1
)
or
remained
uninfected
(
as
control
)
for
12
,
24
,
and
48hrs
.

Because
2B4
cells
were
also
permissive
to
the
productive
infection
of
Dhori
virus
(
DHOV
)
,
a
member
of
the
Orthomyxoviridae
family
within
the
Thogotovirus
genus
,
resulting
in
robust
responses
of
IFNs
and
other
pro
-
inflammatory
mediators
,
we
also
established
parallel
cultures
of
DHOV
-
infected
2B4
cells
(
MOI=0.1
)
for
the
comparative
analysis
of
global
gene
expression
elicited
by
SARS

CoV-
versus
DHOV

infected
2B4
cells
.

To
meet
the
minimal
number
required
for
application
of
statistical
algorithms
,
we
performed
the
study
in
triplicate
at
each
time
point

Previously
published
results
from
our
double
-
blind
,
placebo
-
controlled
parallel
study
with
docosahexaenoic
acid
(
DHA
)
supplementation
(
3
g
/
d
,
90
d
)
to
hypertriglyceridemic
men
(
39
-
66yr
)
showed
that
DHA
reduced
several
risk
factors
for
cardiovascular
disease
(
CVD
)
,
including
the
plasma
concentration
of
inflammatory
markers
.

To
determine
the
effect
of
DHA
supplementation
on
the
global
gene
expression
pattern
,
we
performed
Affymetrix
GeneChip
microarray
analysis
of
blood
cells
(
treated
with
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
)
or
vehicle
)
drawn
before
and
after
the
supplementation
from
the
hyperlipidemic
men
who
participated
in
the
previous
study
.

Genes
that
were
significantly
differentially
regulated
by
the
LPS
treatment
and
DHA
supplementation
were
identified
.

Differential
regulation
of
18
genes
was
then
confirmed
by
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
.

Both
microarray
and
qRT
-
PCR
data
showed
that
the
expression
of
LDL
receptor
(
LDLR
)
,
oxidized
LDL
receptor
(
OLR1
)
,
and
cathepsin
L1
(
CTSL
)
was
significantly
suppressed
by
DHA
supplementation
;
however
,
LPS
stimulated
the
expression
of
LDLR
and
CTSL
but
not
that
of
OLR1
.

LPS
up
-
regulated
and
DHA
suppressed
the
expression
of
prostaglandin
E
synthase
(
PTGES
)
,
PPAR
delta
,
and
various
chemokines
.

Enrichment
with
Gene
Ontology
categories
demonstrated
that
the
genes
related
to
transcription
factor
activity
,
immune
responses
,
host
defense
responses
,
inflammatory
responses
,
and
apoptosis
were
inversely
regulated
by
LPS
and
DHA
.

These
results
provide
supporting
evidence
for
the
anti
-
inflammatory
effects
of
DHA
supplementation
,
and
reveal
previously
unrecognized
genes
that
are
regulated
by
DHA
,
and
are
associated
with
risk
factors
of
cardiovascular
diseases
.

Twenty

were
up

Known

of
these

relate
to
paracrine

,
transcriptional

,
extracellular

and

.

Ten
genes
(

)
were
down

regulated
in

,
including
the
pluripotency
transcription
factor

.

Quantitative

analysis
of

genes
validated
the
array

.

Immunohistochemical
staining
for

gene
products
confirmed
stromal
expression
in
terms
of
location
and
relative
quantity
.

Surprisingly
,
the
variability
of
gene
expression
was
slightly
higher
in
NF
than
in
CAF
,
suggesting
inter

individual
heterogeneity
of
normal
stroma
.

Paired
CAF

NF
were
isolated
from
six
primary

Background
:
 
Prostate
cancer
is
the
second
leading
cause
of
cancer
mortality
among
US
men
.

 
Epidemiological
evidence
suggests
that
high
vitamin
D
status
protects
men
from
prostate
cancer
and
the
active
form
of
vitamin
D
,
1_,25
dihydroxyvitamin
D3
(
1,25(OH)2D
)
has
anti
-
cancer
effects
in
cultured
prostate
cells
.

Still
,
the
molecular
mechanisms
and
the
gene
targets
for
vitamin
D
-
mediated
prostate
cancer
prevention
are
unknown
.

 
Results
:
We
examined
the

of
1,25(OH)2D
(

,
6
,
24
,

)
on
the

(
Affymetrix

)
.

Our
analysis
revealed
many
transcript
level
changes
at
a
5
%
false
detection
rate
:
6

,
1571
(

1816
(

)
,
48

,
3566
(

)
.

288
transcripts
were
regulated
similarly
at
all
time
points
(
182
up
,
80
down
)
and
many
of
the
promoters
for
these
transcripts
contained
putative
vitamin
D
response
elements
.

 
Functional
analysis

or
Gene
Set
Analysis
revealed
early
suppression
of
WNT
,
Notch
,
NF

kB
,
and
IGF1
signaling
.

 
Transcripts
related
to
inflammation
were
suppressed
at
6
h
(
e.g.
IL-1
pathway
)
and
suppression
of
proinflammatory
pathways
continued
at
later
time
points
(
e.g.
IL-17
and
IL-6
pathways
)
.

 
There
was
also
evidence
for
induction
of
anti
-
angiogenic
pathways
and
induction
of
transcripts
for
protection
from
oxidative
stress
or
maintenance
of
cell
redox
homeostasis
at
6
h.
  
Conclusions
:
Our
data
reveal
of
large
number
of
potential
new
,
direct
vitamin
D
target
genes
relevant
to
prostate
cancer
prevention
.

 
In
addition
,
our
data
suggests
that
rather
than
having
a
single
strong
regulatory
effect
,
vitamin
D
orchestrates
a
pattern
of
changes
within
prostate
epithelial
cells
that
limit
or
slow
carcinogenesis
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
RWPE1
cells
were
treated
with
medium
containing
100
nM
of
1,25(OH)2D
or
vehicle
(
0.1
%
ethanol
)
for
6
,
24
or
48
hours
(
n=4
per
treatment
,
24
total
samples
)
.

The
transcripts
levels
in
each
sample
were
measured
by
using
the
Affymetrix
HU133
plus
2.0
GeneChip
(
Affymetrix
,
Santa
Clara
,
CA
)
.

We
used
microarrays
to
detail
the
global
program
of
gene
expression
between
Chinese
gastric
cancer
and
its
adjacent
noncancer
tissues
and
identified
some
key
differential
expression
genes
in
cancer
.

Gene
expression
profiling
is
a
valuable
tool
for
identifying
differentially
expressed
genes
in
studies
of
gastric
cancer
.

However
,
it
remains
difficult
to
assign
biological
significance
to
the
vast
number
of
genes
.

There
is
an
increasing
awareness
of
gene
expression
profile
as
an
important
part
of
the
contextual
molecular
network
at
play
in
cancer
initiation
and
progression
.

The
key
pathways
or
genes
might
be
the
target
for
our
clinical
curement
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
This
study
analysed
the
transcriptional

commonly
activated
at
different

of
gastric
cancers
using
an
integrated
approach
combining
gene
expression
profiling
of
12
adjacent
normal

-
matched
gastric
tissues
to
form
a

.

We
sought
to
obtain
homogeneous
populations
of
cancer
tissues
at
each
TNM
stage
in
order
to
increase
the
accurateness
of
expression
profiles
.

In
addition
we
performed
this
test
in
3
normal
tissues
in
order
to
get
data
for
further

.

Infliximab
,
an
anti

,
is
an

with
over
60
%
of
patients
responding
to
treatment
and
up
to
30
%
reaching

.

The
mechanism
of
resistance
to
anti

However
,
the

We
aimed

The
success
of
TNF
inhibitors
for
treatment
of
psoriasis
and
other
inflammatory
diseases
was
previously
attributed
to
blockade
of
innate
immunity
.

 
In
a
clinical
trial
using
etanercept
TNF
blocking
agent
to
treat
psoriasis
vulgaris
,
we
used
affymetrix
gene
arrays
to
analyze
broad
gene
profiles
in
lesional
skin
at
multiple
timepoints
during
drug
treatment
(
baseline
,
and
weeks
1
,
2
,
4
and
12
)
compared
to
non
-
lesional
skin
.

 
This
analysis
created
a
temporal
model
of
TNF
-
dependent
gene
regulation
that
informs
molecular
mechanisms
of
TNF
-
mediated
inflammation
.

 
We
identified
four
gene
clusters
that
were
differentially
down
-
modulated
during
etanercept
treatment
:
the
cluster
down
-
regulated
most
rapidly
contained
mostly
dendritic
cell
activation
genes
.

 
Culturing
human
keratinocytes
with
TNF
,
IFNg
and
IL-17
generated
a
list
of
keratinocyte
genes
regulated
by
each
cytokine
.

 
The
IL-17
pathway
genes
were
strongly
down
-
modulated
early
,
whereas
IFNg
pathway
genes
were
not
down
-
modulated
until
final
disease
resolution
at
week
12
.

 
Finally
,
we
show
that
TNF
blockade
rapidly
inhibits
IL-12
/
IL-23
p40
subunit
expression
,
and
that
p40
neutralization
inhibits
psoriatic
dermal
emigre
-
mediated
Th17
polarization
.

 
We
hypothesize
that
etanercept
inhibits
myeloid
dendritic
cell
production
of
IL-23
,
a
Th17
survival
cytokine
,
resulting
in
rapid
downregulation
of
IL-17
pathway
genes
.

 
This
data
links
effects
of
TNF
blockade
on
the
innate
immune
system
with
the
adaptive

We
hypothesized
that
patients
with

Microarray

was
done

.

Comparing

from
patients

to
controls
,
872
transcripts
were
upregulated
and
1039
were
downregulated
at

1.5
-
fold
change
and
a
significant
q
value
.

Several
transcripts
associated
with
interferon
and

were
upregulated
.

Lung

analyses
also
showed
dramatic
increases
in

Granulomas
in

of
patients
with
sarcoidosis
expressed
abundant
STAT1
and
phosphorylated
STAT1
.

STAT1
might
play
an
important
role
in
sarcoidosis
.

This
novel
hypothesis
unites
seemingly
disparate
observations
with
regard
to
sarcoidosis
including
implication
of
a
casual
role
for
interferons
,
a
suspected

trigger
,
TH1

,
and
the

This

tested
the
hypothesis
that
SpA
is
characterized
by
a
distinct
pattern
of

compared
with

were
used
to

mRNA
of

from
18

with

and
25
normal
individuals
.

Samples
were
processed
as
two
separate
sets
at
different
times
.

Blood
samples
were
taken
at
a
time
when
patients
were
not

immunomodulatory
therapy
.

Differential

was
defined
as
a

with
a

<

%
.

Gene

and
pathway
information
were
also
studied
.

Signals
from
134
probe
sets
(
representing
95
known
and
12
unknown
gene
transcripts
)
were
consistently
different
from
controls
in
both
Sets
1
and
2
.

 
Included
among
these
were
transcripts
for
a
group
of
20
genes
,
such
as
interleukin-1
receptors
1
and
2
,
NLRP2
,
SLPI
,
SPARC
,
and
TREM-1
that
are
clearly
related
to
the
immune
or
inflammatory
response
and
a
group
of
4
transcripts
that
have
a
strong
role
in
bone
remodeling
.

Our
observations
are
the
first
to
implicate
SPARC
,
SLPI
,
and
NLRP2
,
a
component
of
the
innate
immune
system
,
in
the
pathogenesis
of
SpA.
Our
results
also
indicate
a
possible
role
for
interleukin-1
and
its
receptors
in
SpA.

In
accord
with
the
bone
pathology
component
of
SpA
,
we
also
found
that
expression
levels
of
transcripts
reflecting
bone
remodeling
factors
are
also
distinguishable
in
peripheral
blood
from
patients
with
SpA
versus
controls
.

 
These
results
confirm
some
previously
identified
biomarkers
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
SpA
and
also
point
to
novel
mediators
in
this

Among
the
upregulated
genes
,
we
identified
a
group
of
chemokine
ligands
,
apoptosis
genes
and
,
interestingly
,
keratin

.

Central
hubs
regulating
the
activated
genes
were
TNF-

,
NF-_B
and
their
ligands
/
receptors
.

Other
activated
genes
included
IL-1
_
and
IL-18
.

RNA
for
these
,
and
several
additional
cytokines
including
IL-6
,
IL-1
_
,
IP-10
and
GM

CSF
,
were
differentially
expressed
from
1.6-
to
27

fold
.

The
microarray
cytokine
data
is
consistent
with
our
previously
published
findings
which
demonstrated
that
there
was
4-

fold
induction
of
these
cytokines
at
the
transcriptional

translational
levels
as
determined
by

.

The
PAINT
analysis
revealed
that
the
majority
of
the
genes
affected
by
spores
contain
the
binding
site
for
c

Rel
,
a
member
of

In
this
paper
,
we
exposed
HAM
to

Sterne
spores
at
an
MOI
of

for
6
hours
.

RNA
was
extracted
from
HAM
and
analyzed
by
the

.

The
transcriptional

of
Bacillus

HAM
was
compared
with
mock

,
and
differentially

.

Unsupervised

revealed
a
strong

We
have
studied
the
genes
activated
in
human
liver
transplantation
to
identify
potential
target
genes
for
the
prevention
or
treatment
of
related
injuries
.

 
In
a
first
protocol
,
in
order
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
Ischemia
-
Reperfusion
Injury
(
IRI
)
on
gene
expression
profile
,
we
compared
gene
expression
levels
in
transplanted
-
reperfused
livers
 
versus
basal
values
in
donor
livers
,
identifying
795
genes
significantly
modified
in
human
liver
after
transplantation
.

Some
genes
are
likely
to
be
completely
activated
by
IRI
,
as
they
are
not
expressed
at
all
in
basal
livers
.

 
In
a
second
protocol
,
in
order
to
identify
gene
dysregulations
already
present
in
donor
livers
,
which
might
affect
gene
expression
profile
after
transplantation
,
gene
expression
evaluated
in
the
first
study
was
compared
to
control
livers
(
espression
data
retrieved
from
ArrayExpress
database
)
.

About
900
genes
in
donor
livers
are
dysregulated
if
compared
to
the
control
condition
.

At
least
400
of
them
remain
dysregulated
or
become
more
and
more
dysregulated
after
transplantation
.

  

For
the
first
protocol
,
two
biopsies
were
collected
from
each
liver
:
1
biopsy
before
explantation
from
the
donor
,
immediately
after
opening
,
before
ice
was
applied
,
and
1
biopsy
about
2
-
3
hours
after
liver
reperfusion
in
the
recipient
organism
.

Gene
expression
of
5
transplanted
livers
was
compared
to
that
of
5
donor
livers
.

In
the
second
protocol
gene
expression
both
of
transplanted
and
donor
livers
was
compared
to

This
dataset
is
part
of
the
TransQST
collection
.

Studies
in
mice
have
shown
that
PPARalpha
is
an
important
regulator
of
hepatic
lipid
metabolism
and
the
acute
phase
response
.

However
,
little
information
is
available
on
the
role
of
PPARalpha
in
human
liver
.

Here
we
set
out
to
compare
the
function
of
PPARalpha
in
mouse
and
human
hepatocytes
via
analysis
of
target
gene
regulation
.

Primary
hepatocytes
from
6
human
and
6
mouse
donors
were
treated
with
PPARalpha
agonist
Wy14643
and
gene
expression
profiling
was
performed
using
Affymetrix
GeneChips
followed
by
a
systems
biology
analysis
.

Baseline
PPARalpha
expression
was
similar
in
human
and
mouse
hepatocytes
.

Depending
on
 
species
and
time
of
exposure
,
Wy14643
significantly
induced
the
expression
of
362
-
672
genes
.

Surprisingly
minor
overlap
was
observed
between
the
Wy14643
-
regulated
genes
from
mouse
and
human
,
although
more
substantial
overlap
was
observed
at
the
pathway
level
.

Xenobiotics
metabolism
and
apolipoprotein
synthesis
were
specifically
regulated
by
PPARalpha
in
human
hepatocytes
,
whereas
glycolysis
-
gluconeogenesis
was
regulated
specifically
in
mouse
hepatocytes
.

Most
of
the
genes
commonly
regulated
in
mouse
and
human
were
involved
in
lipid
metabolism
and
many
represented
known
PPARalpha
targets
,
including
CPT1A
,
HMGCS2
,
FABP
,
ACSL
,
and
ADFP
.

Several
genes
were
identified
that
were
specifically
induced
by
PPARalpha
in
human
(
MBL2
,
ALAS1
,
CYP1A1
,
TSKU
)
or
mouse
(
Fbp2
,
lgals4
,
Cd36
,
Ucp2
,
Pxmp4
)
.

Furthermore
,
several
putative
novel
PPARalpha
targets
were
identified
that
were
commonly
regulated
in
both
species
,
including
CREB3L3
,
KLF10
,
KLF11
and
MAP3K8
.

Our
results
suggest
that
PPARalpha
activation
has
a
major
impact
on
gene
regulation
in
human
hepatocytes
.

Importantly
,
the
role
of
PPARalpha
as
master
regulator
of
hepatic
lipid
metabolism
is
generally
well
-
conserved
between
mouse
and
human
.

Overall
,
however
,
PPARalpha
regulates
a
mostly
divergent
set
of
genes
in
mouse
and
human
hepatocytes
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Primary
hepatocytes
from
6
human
subjects
were
treated
with
the
PPARalpha
agonist
Wy14643
for
6
and
24
hours
,
and
gene
expression
profiling
was
performed
using
Affymetrix
GeneChips
.

 
Human
hepatocytes
and
Hepatocyte
Culture
Medium
Bulletkit
were
purchased
from
Lonza
Bioscience
(
Verviers
,

)
.

Primary
hepatocytes
were
isolated
from
surgical
liver
biopsies
obtained
from
six
individual
donors
who
underwent
surgery
after
informed
consent
was
obtained
for
surgery
with
subsequent
use
of
samples
in
experiments
.

Hepatocytes
were
isolated
with
two

step
collagenase
perfusion
method
and
the
viability
of
the
cells
was
over
80
%
.

 
Cells
were
plated
on
collagen
-
coated
six

well
plates
and
filled
with
maintenance
medium
.

Upon
arrival
of
the
cells
,
the
medium
was
discarded
and
was
replaced
by
Hepatocyte

(

)
with

Epigenetic

modifications
by

have
recently
been

.

Chronic
Lymphocytic
Leukemia
(
CLL
)
remains
incurable
despite
the
introduction
of
new

.

CLL
cells
are
characterized
by
an

defect
rather
than
excessive
proliferation
,
but
proliferation
centers
have
been
found
in
organs
such
as

Here
,
we
investigated
gene

in
CLL
cells
following

Human
peripheral
blood
monocytes
(
Mo
)
consist
of
subsets
distinguished
by
expression
of
CD16
(
FCGRIII
)
and
chemokine
receptors
.

Classical
CD16-

Mo
express
CCR2
and
migrate
in
response
to
CCL2
,
while
a
minor
CD16
+
Mo
subset
expresses
CX3CR1
and
migrates
into
tissues
expressing
CX3CL1
.

CD16
+
Mo
produce
pro
-
inflammatory
cytokines
and
are
expanded
in
certain
inflammatory
conditions
including
HIV
infection
.

To
gain
insight
into
the
developmental
relationship
and
functions
of
CD16
+
and
CD16-
Mo
,
we
examined
transcriptional
profiles
of
these
Mo
subsets
in
peripheral
blood
from
healthy
individuals
.

Of
16,328
expressed
genes
,
2,759
genes
were
differentially
expressed
and
228
and
250
were
>

fold
upregulated
and
downregulated
,
respectively
,
in
CD16

compared
to
CD16-

CD16

were
distinguished
by
upregulation
of

(

,
and
negative

of
the

(

,
whereas
CD16-

were
distinguished
by
upregulation
of
myeloid

,

,

)
and

(

,

-

)
.

Differential
gene
expression
in
CD16

and
CD16-

Mo
was
confirmed
by
quantitative
real
time
RT

PCR
(
i.e.
,
CD16
,
C3AR1
,
C1QR1
,

,
and
CX3CR1
)
.

Furthermore
,
increased
expression
of
RARA
and
KLF2
transcripts
in
CD16
+
Mo
coincided
with
absence
of
cutaneous
lymphocyte
associated
antigen
(
CLA
)
expression
,
indicating
potential
imprinting
for
non

skin
homing
.

These
results
suggest
that
CD16
+
and
CD16-
Mo
originate
from
a
common
myeloid
precursor
,
with
CD16
+
Mo
having
a
more
MF-
and
DC
-
like
transcription
program
suggesting
a
more
advanced
stage
of
differentiation
.

Distinct
transcriptional
programs
,
together
with
their
recruitment
into
tissues
via
different
mechanisms
,
also
suggest
that
CD16
+
and
CD16-
Mo
give
rise
to
functionally
distinct
DC
and
MF
in

.

The

.

Neuroblastoma

were
analyzed
for

.

We
used

.

Total

We

Proliferative
breast
lesions
,
such
as
simple
ductal
hyperplasia
(
SH
)
and
atypical
ductal
hyperplasia
(
ADH
)
,
are
candidate
precursors
to
ductal
carcinoma
in

(
DCIS
)
and
invasive
cancer
.

To
better
understand
their
relationship
to
more
advanced
disease
,
we
used
microdissection
and
DNA
microarrays
to
profile
the
gene
expression
of
patient

matched
histologically
normal
(
HN
)
,
ADH
,
and
DCIS
from
12
patients
with
ER+
sporadic
breast
cancer
.

SH
were
profiled
from
a
subset
of
cases
.

We
found
837
differentially
expressed
genes
between
DCIS
-
HN
and
447
between
ADH
-
HN
,
with
>
90
%
of
the
ADH
-
HN
genes
also
present
among
the
DCIS
-
HN
genes
.

Only
61
genes
were
identified
between
ADH
-
DCIS
.

Expression
differences
were
reproduced
in
an
independent
cohort
of
patient
-
matched
lesions
by
qRT
-
PCR
.

Many
breast
cancer
-
related
genes
and
pathways
were
dysregulated
in
ADH
and
maintained
in
DCIS
.

Particularly
,
cell
adhesion
and
extracellular
matrix
(
ECM
)
interactions
were
overrepresented
.

Focal
adhesion
was
the
top
pathway
in
each
gene
set
.

We
conclude
that
ADH
and
DCIS
share
highly
similar
gene
expression
and
are
distinct
from
HN
.

In
contrast
,
SH
appear
more
similar
to
HN
.

These
data
provide
genetic
evidence
that
ADH
(
but
not
SH
)
are
often
precursors
to
cancer
and
suggest
cancer
-
related
genetic
changes
,
particularly
adhesion
and
ECM
pathways
,
are
dysregulated
prior

and
even
before

The
goal
of
the
experiment
:
To
characterize
the
dynamic
gene
expression
profile
of
engineered
human
skin
in
vitro
and
after
grafting
,
and
compare
with
expression
profile
of
uninjured
human
skin
.

Bioengineered
skin
substitutes
can
facilitate
wound
closure
in
massively
burned
patients
,
but
deficiencies
limit
their
outcomes
compared
to
native
skin
autografts
.

To
identify
gene
programs
associated
with
their
in
vivo
capabilities
and
limitations
,
we
extended
previous
gene
expression
profile
analyses
to
now
compare
engineered
skin
following
in
vivo
grafting
to
both
in
vitro
maturation
and
to
normal
human
skin
.

Cultured
skin
substitutes
were
grafted
to
full
-
thickness
wounds
in
athymic
mice
;
biopsies
for
microarray
analyses
were
collected
at
multiple
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
time
points
.

Over
10,000
transcripts
exhibited
large
-
scale
expression
pattern
differences
during
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
maturation
.

Using
hierarchical
clustering
,
eleven
different
expression
profile
clusters
were
partitioned
based
on
differential
sample
type
and
temporal
stage
-
specific
activation
or
repression
.

Analyses
show
that
the
wound
environment
exerts
a
massive
influence
on
gene
expression
in
skin
substitutes
.

For
example
,
in
vivo
healed
skin
substitutes
gained
expression
of
many
native
skin
-
expressed
genes
,
including
those
associated
with
epidermal
barrier
and
multiple
categories
of
cell
-
cell
and
cell
-
basement

Gastrointestinal
stromal
tumours
(
GISTs
)
represent
a
heterogeneous
group
of
tumours
of
mesenchymal
origin
characterized
by
gain

function
mutations
in
KIT
or
PDGFRA
of
the
type
III
receptor
tyrosine

family
.

Although
mutations
in
either
receptor
are
thought
to
drive
an
early
oncogenic
event
through
similar
pathways
,
two
previous

reported
the

.

However
,
their
further
conclusions
were
rather
discordant
.

To
clarify
the
molecular

,
we
combined

is
an
effective
treatment
for
ulcerative

inducing
over
60

about
40

This

Alzheimer
's
Disease
(
AD
)
is
a
devastating
neurodegenerative
disorder
affecting
approximately
4
million
people
in
the
U.S.
alone
.

 
AD
is
characterized
by
the
presence
of
senile
plaques
and
neurofibrillary
tangles
in
cortical
regions
of
the
brain
.

 
These
pathological
markers
are
thought
to
be
responsible
for
the
massive
cortical
neurodegeneration
and
concomitant
loss
of
memory
,
reasoning
,
and
often
aberrant
behaviors
that
are
seen
in
patients
with
AD
.

 
Understanding
the
molecular
mechanisms
whereby
these
histopathological
markers
develop
will
greatly
enhance
our
understanding
of
AD
development
and
progression
.

 
A
clearer
understanding
of
the
mechanisms
underlying
neurofibrillary
tangle
formation
specifically
may
help
to
clarify
the
basis
for
dementia
of
AD
as
well
as
the
dementias
associated
with
other
diseases
that
are
collectively
referred
to
as
"
tauopathies
.

"
;

To
expression
profile
both
neurons
containing
neurofibrillary
tangles
and
normal
neurons
from
the
entorhinal
cortex
of
10
mid
-
stage
AD
cases
.

The
gene
expression
profile
of
neurons
that
contain
neurofibrillary
tangles
will
differ
from
the
expression
profile
of
histopathologically
normal
neurons
from
the
same
patient
and
from
the
same
brain
region
.

 
Some
of
these
differences
will
be
informative
as
to
the
mechanisms
of
tangle
formation
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
First
use
laser
capture

to
select
1000
neurons
bearing
neurofibrillary
tangles
and
1000
normal

from
the
layer

stellate
island
neurons
of
the
entorhinal
cortex
of
10
mid

stage
AD
cases
.

 
Second
,
to
isolate
the
RNA
from
these
captured
neurons
,
perform
double
round
linear

and
hybridize
the

.

 
Third
,
to
use
paired

to
analyze
the

However
,
all

Molecular
mechanisms
of
cell
cycle

are
poorly
understood
.

A
group
of
genes
required
for
cell
cycle
exit
and
maintenance
of
cell
quiescence
in
human
fibroblasts
following
serum
deprivation
has
been
recently
identified
.

Studies
on
lymphocytes
following
growth
factor
deprivation
-
induced
cell
cycle
exit
have
predominantly
focused
on
the
initiation
of
apoptosis
.

A
set
of
genes
involved
in
lymphocyte
quiescence
have
also
been
identified
among
genes
highly
expressed
in
resting
lymphocytes
and
down
-
regulated
after
cell
activation
.

In
our
study
,
proliferating
IL-2
-
dependent
human
T
cells
were
forced
to
exit
cell
cycle
by
growth
factor
withdrawal
,
and
their
gene
expression
profiles
were
examined
.

The
differential
gene
expression
analysis
was
performed
in
primary
and
immortalized
IL-2
-
dependent
T
lymphocytes
.

Cell
samples
were
collected
directly
from
the
IL-2
-
containing
cultures
and
8
-
hrs
following
IL-2
withdrawal
,
before
apoptosis
could
be
evidenced
by
the
Annexin
-
V
staining
.

The
three
primary
T
lymphoblast
cell
populations
were
obtained
from
the
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
stimulated
for
24h
by
wheat
germ
agglutinin
and
cultured
in
the
presence
of
IL-2
up
to
4
-
8
population
doublings
.

As
shown
by
the
cell
surface
analysis
,
these
populations
were
composed
of
T
cells
exclusively
.

Samples
of
these
cell
populations
were
subsequently
analyzed
as
biological
replicates
.

Two
spontaneously
immortalized
IL-2
-
dependent
T
cell
lines
were
derived
from
normal
spleen
and
from
PBMC
derived
from
Nijmegen
Breakage

patient
.

Gene
expression
was
assessed
by
the
Affymetrix
microarray
HG
-
U133
2.0
Plus
that
detects
38,500
genes
.

The
expression
of
a
selected
number
of
genes
was
verified
by
the
qRT
-
PCR
method
.

We
have
identified
a
set
of
53
genes
that
we
called
a
‚Ä∞??T
lymphocyte
cell
cycle
exit
signature‚Ä∞
?
?
,
comprised
of
13
up
-
regulated
and
40
down
-
regulated
genes
.

Genes
linked
to
transcription
,
cell
cycle
,
cell
growth
,
proliferation
and
differentiation
,
cell
adhesion
and
immune
functions
were
found
to
be
overrepresented
among
the
differentially
expressed
,
before
and
after
IL-2
deprivation
.

Among
those
,
PIM1
,
BCL2
,
IL-8
,
HBEGF
,
DUSP6
,
OSM
,
CISH
,
SOCS2
,
SOCS3
,
LIF
and
IL13
were
down

regulated
and
RPS24
,
SQSTM1
,
TMEM1
,
LRRC8D
,
ECOP
,
YY1AP1
,
C1orf63
,
ASAH1
,
SLC25A46
and
MIA3
were
up
-
regulated
.

Identification
of
genes
involved
in
cell
cycle
exit
and
quiescence
,
may
provide
new
insights
into
the
mechanisms
of
tissue
repair
and
regeneration
as
well
as
of

.

We
report
that

Background
:
When
exposed
to
specific
stimuli
,
macrophages
exhibit
distinct
activation
programs
,
M1
and
M2
polarization
,
that
define
macrophage
function
as
inflammatory
/
immune
effectors
or
anti
-
inflammatory
/
tissue
remodeling
cells
,
respectively
.

Due
to
their
position
on
the
lung
epithelial
surface
,
alveolar
macrophages
(
AM
)
directly
interact
with
environmental
stimuli
such
as
cigarette
smoke
,
the
major
risk
factor
for
the
development
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
.

Based
on
the
current
paradigm
that
,
in
response
to
smoking
,
AM
contribute
to
both
inflammatory
and
tissue
remodeling
processes
in
the
lung
relevant
to
the
pathogenesis
of
COPD
,
we
hypothesized
that
chronic
exposure
to
cigarette
smoking
activates
both
the
M1
and
M2
polarization
programs
in
AM
.

Methods
and
Findings
:
To
assess
this
hypothesis
,
global
transcriptional
profiling
with
TaqMan
confirmation
and
flow
cytometry
analysis
was
carried
out
on
AM
obtained
by
bronchoalveolar
lavage
of
24
healthy
nonsmokers
,
34
healthy
smokers
and
12
smokers
with
COPD
to
assess
the
expression
of
41
M1
genes
and
32
M2
genes
in
each
group
.

Contrary
to
our
expectations
,
while
there
was
up
-
regulation
of
some
genes
typical
for
M2
-
related
phenotypes
,
AM
of
healthy
smokers
exhibited
substantial
suppression
of
M1
-
related
inflammatory
/
immune
genes
.

These
M1-
and
M2
-
related
changes
progressed
with
the
development
of
smoking
-
induced
lung
disease
,
with
AM
of
smokers
with
COPD
exhibiting
further
down
-
regulation
of
M1
-
related
genes
accompanied
with
further
up
-
regulation
of
some
M2
-
related
genes
.

Conclusion
:
The
data
demonstrates
that
the
modifications
of
the
AM
transcriptome
associated
with
smoking
result
in
a
unique
phenotype
characterized
by
reprogramming
of
AM
towards
M1
-
deactivated
partially
M2
-
polarized
macrophages
and
suggests
that
,
while
AM
likely
contribute
to
smoking
-
induced
tissue
remodeling
,
the
role
of
AM
in
the
early
pathogenesis
of
smoking
-
induced
COPD
in
humans
is
not
inflammatory
.

This
concept
is
a
departure
from
the
conventional
concept
that
AM
-
mediated
inflammation
participates
in
the
early
derangements
of
the
lung
induced
by
smoking
,
and
suggests
a
novel
paradigm
for
conceptualizing
COPD
and
developing
new
approaches
to
prevent
the
development
of
smoking
-
induced
lung
disease
.

with
either
the

Understanding
how

,
provides
a

.

Objective
.

Microarray
analysis
was
used
to
determine
whether
children
with
recent
onset
polyarticular
juvenile
idiopathic
arthritis
(
JIA
)
exhibit
biologically
or
clinically
informative
gene
expression
signatures
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(

)
.

  

Methods
.

Peripheral
blood
samples
were
obtained
from
59
healthy
children
and
61
children
with
polyarticular
JIA
prior
to
treatment
with
second
-
line
medications
,
such
as
methotrexate
or
biological
agents
.

 
RNA
was
purified
from

-
isolated
mononuclear
cells
,
fluorescently
labeled
and
then
hybridized
to
Affymetrix
U133
Plus
2.0
GeneChips
.

 
Data
were
analyzed
using

at
a
5
%

rate
threshold
after
Robust

and
Distance

.

  
Results
.

Initial
analysis
revealed
873
probe
sets
for
genes
that
were
differentially
expressed
between
polyarticular
JIA
and
controls
.

 
Hierarchical
clustering
of
these
probe
sets
distinguished
three
subgroups
within
polyarticular
JIA
.

 
Prototypical
subjects
within
each
subgroup
were
identified
and
used
to
define
subgroup
-
specific
gene
expression
signatures
.

 
One
of
these
signatures
was
associated
with
monocyte
markers
,
another
with
transforming
growth
factor
-
beta
-
inducible
genes
,
and
a
third
with
immediate
-
early
genes
.

 
Correlation
of
these
gene
expression
signatures
with
clinical
and
biological
features
of
JIA
subgroups
suggests
direct
relevance
to
aspects
of
disease
activity
and
supports
the
division
of
polyarticular
JIA
into
distinct
subsets
.

 
Conclusions
.

 
PBMC
gene
expression
signatures
in
recent
onset
polyarticular
JIA
reflect
discrete
disease
processes
and
offer
a
molecular
classification
of

subtypes
,
up

of
gene
associated
with

was
identified
that
was
under

Overall
Design
:
This
experiment
consists
of
36
tumor
samples
and
16
normal
samples
;
a
total
of
52
samples
.

16
samples
consist
of
both
tumor
and
normal

data
,
whereas
20
samples
consist
of
only
tumor
data
.

Background
:
Glioblastoma
multiforme
(
GBM
)
is
the
most
aggressive
and
most
lethal
primary
malignant
brain
tumor
,
correlated
with
survival
rates
of
less
than
one
year
from
the
time
of
diagnosis
.

Current
surgical
procedure
attempts
to
remove
the
bulk
of
the
tumor
mass
,
whereas
GBM
frequently
recurs
within
1
-
3
cm
from
the
primary
tumor
resection
site
.

Molecular
mechanisms
involved
in
the
recurrence
of
the
tumor
are
still
poorly
understood
.

The
aim
of
the
study
was
to
define
the
molecular
signature
of
GBM
surrounding
white
matter
(
WM
)
in
order
to
better
understand
the
molecular
mechanisms
involved
with
tumor
relapse
.

 
Material
&
Methods
:
Human
GBM
tumor
bulk
and
surrounding
tissue
(
1
-
3
cm
from
the
border
of
the
tumor
)
were
obtained
from
five
patients
who
underwent
total
tumour
resection
,
while
normal
white
matter
was
harvested
from
patients
who
underwent
surgical
procedure
for
nonmalignant
pathologies
.

Samples
were
processed
for
hybridization
on
the
Affymetrix
Human
U133A
arrays
and
data
were
examined
with
the
GeneSpring
analysis
software
.

 
Results
:
Gene
expression
analysis
of
the
samples
was
done
in
2
independent
steps
.

First
,
molecular
profiling
comparison
of
GBM
surrounding
WM
and
normal
WM
resulted
in
59
genes
differentially
expressed
between
both
tissues
.

Among
these
,
numerous
genes
expressed
by
mature
neural
cells
were
down
-
regulated
in
GBM
surrounding
WM
,
while
gene
products
supporting
invasion
were
overexpressed
.

Moreover
,
KLRC1
,
a
specific
natural
killer
receptor
naturally
involved
in
the
activation
of
antitumoral
cells
was
drastically
repressed
in
GBM
surrounding
WM
,
suggesting
that
the
antitumoral
immune
surveillance
is
compromised
in
this
tissue
.

 
Second
,
we
focused
our
study
on
genes
specifically
regulated
in
GBM
periphery
respectively
to
GBM
core
.

The
highest
up
-
regulated
gene
in
GBM
surrounding
tissue
encodes
for
DTX4
,
a
regulator
of
NOTCH
signalling
pathway
described
for
its
key
role
in
maintaining
neural
progenitors
in
an
uncommitted
state
.

Conclusion
:
This
study
revealed
unique
molecular
characteristics
of
GBM
surrounding
tissue
,
showing
the
dysregulation
of
genes
involved
in
immune
surveillance
along
with
genes
associated
to
stemness
maintenance
.

All
together
,
these
data
may
help
to
understand
the
molecular
mechanisms
associated
with
GBM
recurrence
This
study
attempted
to
define
the
molecular
characteristics
of
the
GBM
surrounding
tissue
.

To
this
end
,
GBM
tumor
samples
were
obtained
from
5
patients
who
underwent
total
tumor
resection
.

Surrounding
tumor
mass
tissue
was
retrieved
in
all
cases
from
not
infiltrated
white
matter
sited
at
2
cm
from
the
macroscopic
tumor
border
.

Furthermore
,
control
white
matter
biopsies
were
harvested
from
patients
operated
on
for
deep
intracerebral
cavernomas
.

Each
sample
was
hybridized
onto
Affymetrix
human
U133
arrays
.

For
each
patient
,
tumor
core
sample
and
surrounding
tissue
were
harvested
and
are
identified
with
the
same
suffix
number
.

In
2
cases
,
(
patients
3
and
4
)
,
two
tumor
peripheral
tissue
samples
were
harvested
and
are
identified
with

Objective
:
Ovarian
tumors
of

and
low

grade
serous
ovarian
carcinomas
are
thought
to
represent
different
stages
on
a
tumorigenic
continuum
and
to
develop
along
pathways
distinct
from
that
of
high
-
grade
serous
ovarian
carcinoma
.

 
Past
studies
have
utilized
gene
expression
profiles
to
support
this
theory
.

 
The
objective
of
the
current
study
was
to
identify
new
genes
whose
expression
profiles
in
LMP
ovarian
tumors
and
low
-

that
in

and
from
10

.

 
We
also
examined
 
PAX2

of
protein
extracted
from
a

Results
:

,
and

.

 
Western

revealed
strong
PAX2

in
ovarian

and
low

carcinoma
samples
but
no
PAX2
protein
expression
in
high

.

On
IHC
,
more
LMP
tumor
and
low
-
grade
carcinoma
samples
expressed
moderate
to
high
levels
of
PAX2
than
did
high
-
grade
ovarian
carcinoma
samples
.

The
numbers
of
samples
with
strong
nuclear
staining
was
significantly
higher
for
ovarian

tumors
(

)
and

than
for

.

  
Discussion
:
 
Our
identification
and
validation
of
higher
PAX2
expression
in
ovarian
LMP
tumors
and
low

grade
serous
carcinomas
than
in

supports
the
two

hypothesis
that
the
first
two
are
on

continuum
and
are
distinct
from
high

undergoing
elective
cholecystectomy
and
13
obese
subjects
(
with
or
without
Type
2
diabetes
)
undergoing

bypass
surgery
.

 
Subjects
with
diabetes
were
classified
as
either
well

controlled
or
poorly

.

Negative
immunomagnetic
selection
has
become
the
method
of
choice
for
isolating
T
cell
subsets
for
functional
studies
due
to
concerns
that
directly
binding
antibody
to
the
surface
of
a
cell
,
as
occurs
with
positive
selection
,
results
in
cross
-
linking
of
surface
antigens
,
altered
gene
transcription
and
subsequent
cellular
activation
.

However
there
is
little
data
to
support
this
.

We
therefore
examined
the
impact
of
the
method
of
immunomagnetic
cell
selection
on
the
gene
expression
profile
of
healthy
human
CD4
and
CD8
T
cells
in
a
total
of
21
cases
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
This

was
composed
of
4

,
CD8

.

Two

were
removed
from
the

due
to

Laminar
shear
stress
due
to
constant
blood
flow
is
known
to
play
a
critical
role
in
maintaining
vascular
health
.

In
contrast
,
endothelial
cell
senescence
appears
to
be
closely
associated
with
the
incidence
of
vascular
disorder
.

In
an
attempt
to
identify
functional
biomarkers
for
age
-
related
vascular
health
/
disease
,
the
present
study
investigated
differential
gene
expression
of
young
and
senescent
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
(
HUVECs
)
under
static
and
laminar
shear
stress
.

We
used
a
cDNA
microarray
method
to
compare
gene
expression
profiles
of
young
and
senescent
HUVECs
under
static
and
laminar
shear
stress
conditions
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:

Senescent
cells
were
prepared
by
continuous
subculture
in

,
and
a
cone
-
and
-
plate
device
was
used
to
impose
laminar
shear
stress
onto
cells
.

Young
and
senescent
cells
were
exposed
to
laminar
shear
stress
or
maintained
under
static
conditions
.

Total
mRNA
was
extracted
and
gene
expression
profiles
were
analyzed
by
cDNA
microarray
.

Interstitial
cystitis
(
IC
)
is
a
progressive
chronic
bladder
disease
with
an
increasing
incidence
.

Today
,
IC
is
diagnosed
by
subjective
symptoms
in
combination
with
cystoscopic
and
histologic
evidence
.

The
ultimate
goal
is
the
development
of
a
diagnostic
assay
for
IC
on
a
molecular
level
.

A
comparative
gene
expression
profile
of
bladder
biopsies
from
patients
with
IC
and
control
patients
identified
candidate
marker
genes
for
IC
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Five
IC
patients
and
six
control
patients
(
'
healthy
'
)
have
been
selected
for
the
study
.

All
IC
patients
had
Hunner
's
ulcers
and
,
with
the
exception
of
one
person
,
also
glomerulations
,
whereas
the
control
group
did
not
show
these
cystoscopic
findings
.

From
each
IC
patient
two
biopsies
have
been
taken
,
one
from
an
ulcerated
area
of
the
bladder
(
'
ulcus
'
)
,
and
one
from
an
area
that
macroscopically
looked
'
normal
'
,
'
not
-
inflamed
'
or
not
hyperemic
(
'
ni
'
)
.

One
'
ni
'
sample
has
been
excluded
from
the
study
because
it
had
an
expression
pattern
similar
to
the
healthy
controls
.

Epidemiology
studies
have
linked
exposure
to
pollutant
particles
to
increased
cardiovascular
mortality
and
morbidity
,
however
,
the
mechanism
remains
unknown
.

 
In
this
study
,
we
hypothesized
that
the
ultrafine
fraction
of
ambient
pollutant
particles
would
cause
endothelial
cells
dysfunction
.

We
profiled
gene
expression
of
human
pulmonary
artery
endothelial
cells
(
HPAEC
)
exposed
to
ultrafine
Chapel
Hill
particles
(
UFP
)
(
100_g
/
ml
)
or
vehicle
for
4h
with
Affymetrix
HG
U133
Plus
2.0
chips
(
N
=
4
each
)
.

 
Using
an
unpaired
t
-
test
(
p
<
0.01
,
5
%
false
discovery
rate
)
we
found
426
unique
genes
to
be
differentially
expressed
with
320
upregulated
genes
and
106
downregulated
genes
.

 
Among
these
genes
,
we
noted
upregulation
of
genes
related
to
coagulation
-
inflammation
circuitry
including
tissue
factor
(
F3
)
,
coagulation
factor
II
receptor
-
like
2
(
F2RL2
,
PAR3
)
,
interleukin
(
IL)-6
and
IL-8
.

Upregulation
of
these
genes
were
independently
confirmed
by
RT
-
PCR
and/or
protein
release
.

Genes
related
to
the
CXC
chemokine
family
that
have
been
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
vascular
disease
were
upregulated
,
including
MCP-1
(
2.60
fold
)
,
IL-8
(
2.47
fold
)
,
CXCL1
(
1.41
fold
)
,
CXCL2
(
1.95
fold
)
,
CXCL3
(
2.28
fold
)
and
CXCR4
(
1.30
fold
)
.

In
addition
,
genes
related
to
clotting
independent
signaling
of
F3
were
also
differentially
expressed
,
including
FOS
,
JUN
and
NFKBIA
.

 
Treatment
of
HPAEC
with
UFP
for
16
hours
increased
the
release
of
IL6
and
IL8
by
1.9
-
fold
and
1.8
-
fold
respectively
.

 
Pretreatment
of
HPAEC
with
a
blocking
antibody
against
F3
attenuated
IL6
and
IL8
release
by
30
%
and
70
%
respectively
.

 
Thus
using
gene
profiling
,
we
uncovered
that
UFP
may
induce
vascular
endothelial
cells
to
express
genes
related
to
clotting
and
angiogenesis
.

These
results
provide
a
novel
hypothesis
that
PM
may
cause
cardiovascular
adverse
health
effects
via
induction
of
tissue
factor
in
vascular
endothelial
cells
which
then
triggers
clotting
dependent
and
independent
downstream
signaling
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Human
pulmonary

endothelial
cell
cultures
were
treated
with
Chapel
Hill
Ultrafine
particles
or
with
vehicle
control
for
4h
.

 
4
bological

Macrophages
play
a
critical
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
many
diseases
,
including
rheumatoid
arthritis
,
inflammatory
bowel
disease
and
atherosclerosis
.

 
Monocytes
recruited
into
tissues
from
peripheral
blood
differentiate
into
macrophages
.

 
There
is
limited
data
concerning
the
global
changes
in
the
expression
of
genes
during
monocyte
to
macrophage
,
and
how
the
patterns
of
change
identify
the
mechanism
contributing
to
differentiation
or
macrophage
function
.

 
Employing
the
microarray
technology
,
we
examined
the
transcriptional
profile
of
in
vitro
adherence
-
induced
differentiation
of
primary
human
monocytes
into
macrophages
.

 
We
found
the
significant
up
regulation
of
genes
contributing
to
the
functions
of
macrophage
,
including
signature
patterns
defining
the
induction
of
genes
contributing
to
immunity
and
defense
;
lipid
,
fatty
acid
and
steroid
metabolism
;
cell
adhesion
and
;
carbohydrate
metabolism
;
amino
acid
metabolism
and
endocytosis
.

 
In
contrast
,
a
variety
of
transcription
factors
were
down
regulated
during
monocyte
to
macrophage
differentiation
,
suggesting
that
transcriptional
repression
may
be
important
for
the
transition
from
monocytes
to
macrophages
.

However
,
a
limited
number
of
transcription
factors
were
up
regulated
,
among
these
was
C
/
EBPA
,
which
may
contribute
to
differentiation
by
regulating
down
stream
genes
,
which
a
characteristic
of
differentiated
macrophages
.

 
These
observations
suggest
that
examination
of
the
transcriptional
profile
in
monocytes
and
macrophages
in
patients
may
identify
relevant
therapeutic
targets
in
diseases
such
as
rheumatoid
arthritis
and
atherosclerosis
.

           
Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Total
9
samples
were
analyzed
.

Repeats
of
3
total

samples
from

,
3
samples
from
monocytes
at
16
hours
,
and
other
3
samples
of
monocytes
at
168
hours
after
differentiation
were
collected
.

Following
the
Affymetrix
protocol
,
5
-
10
mg
of
high
quality
RNA
was
used
to
make
labeled
cRNA
.

The
size
distribution
of
fragmented
and
unfragmented
labeled
cRNA
were
assessed
by
2100
Bioanalyzer
(
Agilent

)
.

20
mg
of
fragmented
labeled
cRNA
was
hybridized
to
Human
U133A

GeneChip
at
45C
for
18
hours
.

Affymetrix
fluidics
station
was
used
to
perform
the
washing
and
staining
of
the
chips
.

GeneChip
3000
scanner
system
was
used
to
scan
the
chips
.

The
data
were
normalized
by
dCHIP
method
.

In
polygenic
disorders
we
do
not
know
exactly
,
how
many
genes
are
involved
in
the
pathomechanism
,
but
the
analysis
of
fetal
gene
expression
can
get
us
closer
to
the
solution
.

In
our
study
we
were
searching
for
the
genetic
background
of
the
polygenic
neural
tube
defect
,
which
is
the
second
most
common
birth
defect
in
the
world
(
1
in
1000
live
births
)
.

Our
data
revealed
novel
candidate
genes
,
like
SLAP
,
LST1
and
BENE
,
which
can
play
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
neural
tube
defects
.

We
created
a
data
warehouse
from
the
results
,
suitable
for
further
analysis
.

This
study
also
demonstrates
that
a
routinely
collected
amount
of
amniotic
fluid
(
as
small
as
6
mL
)
is
enough
to
successfully
hybridize
isolated
RNA
to
expression
arrays
,
making
the
ability
to
use
the
technique
from
normally
collected
amniotic
fluid
samples
.

Experiment

We
report
an
in

in
living
human

using
oligonucleotide

analysis
of
fetal

isolated
from
amniocytes
,
which
were
collected
by

In
order
to
address
the
progression
,
metastasis
,
and
clinical
heterogeneity
of
renal
cell
cancer
(
RCC
)
,
transcriptional
profiling
with
oligonucleotide
microarrays
(
22,283
genes
)
was
done
on
49
RCC
tumors
,
20
non
-
RCC
renal
tumors
,
and
23
normal
kidney
samples
.

Samples
were
clustered
based
on
gene
expression
profiles
and
specific
gene
sets
for
each
renal
tumor
type
were
identified
.

Gene
expression
was
correlated
to
disease
progression
and
a
metastasis
gene
signature
was
derived
.

Gene
signatures
were
identified
for
each
tumor
type
with
100
%
accuracy
.

Differentially
expressed
genes
during
early
tumor
formation
and
tumor
progression
to
metastatic
RCC
were
found
.

Subsets
of
these
genes
code
for
secreted
proteins
and
membrane
receptors
and
are
both
potential
therapeutic
or
diagnostic
targets
.

A
gene
pattern
(
"
metastatic
signature
"
)
derived
from
primary
tumors
was
very
accurate
in
classifying
tumors
with
and
without
metastases
at
the
time
of
surgery
.

A
previously
described
"
global
"
metastatic
signature
derived
by
another
group
from
various
non
-
RCC
tumors
was
validated
in
RCC
.

Unlike
previous
studies
,
we
describe
highly
accurate
and
externally
validated
gene
signatures
for
RCC
subtypes
and
other
renal
tumors
.

Interestingly
,
the
gene
expression
of
primary
tumors
provides
us
information
about
the
metastatic
status
in
the
respective
patients
and
has
the
potential
,
if
prospectively
validated
,
to
enrich
the
armamentarium
of
diagnostic
tests
in
RCC
.

We
validated
in
RCC
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
previously
described
metastatic
signature
and
further
showed
the
feasibility
of
applying
a
gene
signature
across
different
microarray
platforms
.

Transcriptional
profiling
allows
a
better
appreciation
of
the
molecular
and
clinical
heterogeneity
in
RCC
.

We
used
the
following
tissue
samples
to
obtain
transcriptional
profiling
of
kidney
tumors
using
Affymetrix
HGU-133A
chips
:

was
utilized
to
define
the

modulated
by
co

culture
with
the
oral
commensal
S.
gordonii
and
the

.

We
used
microarrays
to
detail
the
global
programme
of
gene
expression
underlying
infection
and
identified
distinct
classes
of
up-
and
down

regulated
genes
during
this
process
.

Experiment
Overall

:
Gingival

were
sham

and
infected
with
either
the
oral

)
or
the
opportunistic

.

These
samples
were
hybridized
to
Affymetrix
microarrays
.

Understanding
how
host

have
adapted
to
commensals
,
and
how
barrier

is
a
widely

in
chronic

,
but
mechanisms
by
which
its

remain
to
be
fully
explained
.

In
an
attempt
to
unveil
unfavorable
cellular
properties
linked
to
high
ZAP70

,
we
used
gene

The
pathogenesis
of
acne
has
been
linked
to
multiple
factors
such
as
increased
sebum
production
,
inflammation
,
follicular
hyperkeratinization
,
and
the
action
of
Propionibacterium

within
the

.

13

cis
Retinoic
Acid
(
13
-
cis
RA
,
isotretinoin
)
is
the
most
potent
agent
in
acne
treatment
.

 
Surprisingly
,
its
mechanism
of
action
in
acne
is
still
unknown
.

 
Gene
expression
profiling
of
skin
from
6
patients
treated
with
isotretinoin
was
performed
to
gain
insights
into
its
mechanism
of
action
.

Skin
biopsies
were
obtained
from
the
patients
at
baseline
and
at
one
-
week
isotretinoin
treatment
.

Gene
array
expression
profiling
was
conducted
using
Affymetrix
HG
-
U133A
2.0
arrays
in
order
to
examine
changes
in
gene
expression
as
a
result
of
treatment
.

After
treatment
,
43
genes
were
significantly
changed
:
38
up
-
regulated
and
5
down
-
regulated
.

A
significant
proportion
of
these
genes
are
involved
in
pathways
that
regulate
differentiation
,
tumor
suppression
,
serine
proteases
,
serine
protease
inhibitors
and
solute
transfer
.

These
studies
are
the
first
describing
the
initial
changes
in
gene
expression
associated
with
isotretinoin
therapy
and
are
valuable
in
identifying
potential
therapeutic

Acquired
imatinib
resistance
in
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
(
CML
)
can
be
the
consequence
of
mutations
in
the
kinase
domain
of
BCR
-
ABL
or
increased
protein
levels
.

However
,
as
in
other
malignancies
,
acquired
resistance
to
cytostatic
drugs
is
a
common
reason
for
treatment
failure
or
disease
progression
.

As
a
model
for
drug
resistance
,
we
developed
a
CML

were
also
examined
by

time
PCR
and
flow

.

Neither
the
parent
nor
the
resistant
lines
had
mutations
in
their
ATP
binding
domain
.

Filtering
genes
with
a
low

,
a
total
of
239
genes
showed
significant
changes
(
162
up-
and
77
down
-
regulated
)
in
the
resistant
clone
.

Most
of
the
up

regulated
genes
were
associated
with
metabolism
,
signal

,
or
encoded
enzymes
.

The
gene
for
aldehyde

was
over
-
expressed
more
than
2000
fold
in
the
resistant
clone
.

BCR
-
ABL
was
expressed
in
both
cell
lines
to
a
comparable
extent
.

When
exposed
to
the
tyrosine
kinase
inhibitors
imatinib
and
nilotinib
,
both
lines
were
sensitive
.

In
conclusion
,
we
found
multiple
genetic
changes
in
a
CML
cell
line
resistant
to
CP
related
to
metabolism
,
signal

or
apoptosis
.

Despite
these
changes
,
the
resistant
cells
retained
sensitivity
to
tyrosine

inhibitors
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
A
CML
cell
line
and
a
CP
resistant
subline
were
compared
by
gene
array
.

In
addition
other
markers
,
the
expression
of
BCR
-
ABL
and
the
sensitivity
to
tyrosine

inhibitors
were
tested
.

Our
data
indicated
that
activation
of
the
PPARg
nuclear

induces
a
retinoid
response
in
human
dendritic

.

In
order
to
assess
the
contribution
of
retinoid
signaling
to
the
PPARg
response
we
decided
to
use
a
combination
of
pharmacological
activators
and
inhibitors
of
these
pathways
.

Cells
were
treated
with
the
synthetic
PPARg
ligand
rosiglitazone
(
RSG
)
,
or
with
RSG
along
with
the
RARa
antagonist
(
AGN193109
)
to
block
RARa
mediated
gene
expression
,
or
the
RARa

agonists
(
AM580
)
alone
.

 
This
design
allows
one
to
determine
if
retinoid
signaling
is
a
downstream
event
of
PPARg
activation
and
what
portion
of
PPARg
regulated
genes
are
regulated
via
induced
retinoid
signaling
.

Differences
in

Genes
more

biopsies
(

and
LS-31

)
.

CD3

positive
T
cells
were
negatively
isolated
from
10
SLE
patients
and
9
healthy
controls
without
SLE
.

 
All
of
the
SLE
samples
and
control
samples
were
compared
with
one
another
to
identify
baseline
differences
in
expression
due
to
the
disease
.

 
Next
,
T
cell
preparations
from
4
of
the
control
subjects
were
stimulated
with
either
Nitric
Oxide
(
NOC-18
)
600
uM
for
24hr
or
stimulated
through
CD3
/
CD28
for
24hr
to
determine
which
genes
were
responsive
to
these
signaling
mechanisms
.

Here
,
we
show
that
activity
of
the
mammalian
target
of
rapamycin
(
mTOR
)
,
which
is
a
sensor
of
the
mitochondrial
transmembrane
potential
,
is
increased
in
SLE
T
cells
.

Activation
of
mTOR
was
inducible
by
NO
,
a
key
trigger
of
MHP
which
in
turn
enhanced
the
expression
of
HRES-1
/
Rab4
,
a
small
GTPase
that
regulates
recycling
of
surface
receptors
through
early
endosomes
.

Expression
of
HRES-1
/
Rab4
was
increased
in
SLE
T
cells
and
,
in
accordance
with
its
dominant
impact
on
the
endocytic
recycling
of
CD4
,
it
was
inversely
correlated
with
diminished
CD4
expression
.

HRES-1
/
Rab4
over
-
expression
was
also
inversely
correlated
with
diminished
TCR
_
protein
levels
.

Combined
with
follow
up
studies
,
these
results
suggest
that
activation
of
mTOR
causes
the
loss
of
TCR

in
lupus
T
cells
through
HRES-1

Although
host
genetics
influences
susceptibility
to
tuberculosis
,
few
genes
determining
disease
outcome
have
been
identified
.

We
hypothesized
that
macrophages
from
individuals
with
different
clinical
manifestations
of
tuberculosis
infection
would
have
distinct
gene
expression
profiles
,
and
that
polymorphisms
in
these
genes
may
also
be
associated
with
susceptibility
to
TB
.

We
measured
gene
expression
levels
of
>
38,500
genes
from
ex
vivo
Mtb-
stimulated
macrophages
in
12
subjects
with
3
clinical
phenotypes
:
latent
,
pulmonary
and
meningeal
tuberculosis
(
n=4
per
group
)
.

After
identifying
differentially
expressed
genes
,
we
confirmed
these
results
in
34
additional
subjects
by
real
-
time
PCR
.

 
We
also
used
a
case
-
control
study
design
to
examine
whether
polymorphisms
in
differentially
regulated
genes
were
associated
with
susceptibility
to
these
different
clinical
forms
of
TB
.

We
compared
gene
expression
profiles
in
Mtb
-
stimulated
and
unstimulated
macrophages
and
identified
1608
and
199
genes
that
were
differentially
expressed
by
>
2
and
>
5
-
fold
,
respectively
.

Using
cluster
analysis
,
we
identified
gene
expression
patterns
that
distinguished
the
different
clinical
forms
of
tuberculosis
.

 
In
an
independent
sample
set
of
34
individuals
and
a
subset
of
highly
regulated
genes
,
90
%
of
the
microarray
results
were
confirmed
by
RT
-
PCR
,
including
expression
levels
of
CCL1
,
which
distinguished
the
3
clinical
groups
.

 
Furthermore
,
6
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(
SNPs
)
in
CCL1
were
found
to
be
associated
with
TB
in
a
case
-
control
genetic
association
study
with
273
TB
cases
and
188
controls
.

 
To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
identification
of
CCL1
as
a
gene
involved
in
host
susceptibility
to
TB
and
the
first
study
to
combine
microarray
and
DNA
polymorphism
studies
to
identify
genes
associated
with
TB
susceptibility
.

 
These
results
suggest
that
genome
-
wide
studies
can
provide
an
unbiased
method
to
identify
critical
macrophage
response
genes
that
are
associated
with
different
clinical
outcomes
and
that
variation
in
innate
immune
response
genes
regulate
susceptibility
to
tuberculosis
.

The
skin
is
a
protective
barrier
against
external
insults
and
any
lesion
must
be
rapidly
and
efficiently
repaired
.

Dermal
fibroblasts
are
the
major
source
of
extracellular
connective
tissue
matrix
and
play
an
important
role
in
wound
healing
.

Vitamin
C
is
an
important
water
-
soluble
free
radical
scavenger
and
an
essential
cofactor
for
collagen
synthesis
by
dermal
fibroblasts
and
,
consequently
,
may
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
healthy
skin
.

Using
microarray
analysis
,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
long
-
term
exposure
to
a
stable
vitamin
C
derivative
,
ascorbic
acid
2
-
phosphate
(
AA2P
)
,
in
contact
-
inhibited
populations
of
primary
human
dermal
fibroblasts
.

Compared
with
scorbutic
cells
,
cells
exposed
to
AA2P
increased
the
expression
of
genes
associated
with
DNA
replication
and
repair
and
with
the
G(2)/M
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
.

Consistent
with
the
gene
expression
changes
,
AA2P
increased
the
mitogenic
stimulation
of
quiescent
fibroblasts
by
serum
factors
and
cell
motility
in
the
context
of
wound
healing
.

Furthermore
,
AA2P
-
treated
fibroblasts
showed
faster
repair
of
oxidatively
damaged
DNA
bases
.

We
propose
that
vitamin
C
may
protect
the
skin
by
promoting
fibroblast
proliferation
,
migration
,
and
replication
-
associated
base
excision
repair
of
potentially
mutagenic
DNA
lesions
,
and
we
discuss
the
putative
involvement
of
hypoxia
-
inducible
transcription
factor-1
and
collagen
receptor
-
related
signaling
pathways
.

Experiment

,
the

Psoriasis

provides
an

as

that

and
the

To

we
characterize

The
objective
of
this
study
is
to
identify
the
genes
that
are
up
-
regulated
amid
proteasome
dysfunction
to
facilitate
the
discovery
of
proteolytic
pathways
that
are
activated
as
a
compensatory
response
to
proteasome
inhibition
.

Proteasome
is
a
large
multi
-
component
proteolytic
complex
in
the
cell
.

It
is
responsible
for
the
constitutive
turn
-
over
of
many
cellular
proteins
as
well
as
the
degradation
of
oxidized
and/or
unfolded
proteins
.

With
such
a
fundamental
role
in
the
cell
,
disruption
of
proteasome
understandably
can
lead
to
disastrous
outcome
.

Oxidative
stress
has
been
postulated
as
the
driving
mechanism
for
aging
.

Oxidatively
modified
proteins
,
which
usually
have
lost
their
activity
,
require
immediate
removal
by
proteasome
to
maintain
normal
cellular
function
.

Dysfunction
of
proteasome
has
also
been
linked
to
neuro
-
degenerative
diseases
such
as
Alzheimer–ì—û–í_
‚Ñ¢
s
and
Parkinson–ì—û–í_
‚Ñ¢
s
diseases
,
those
that
are
most
commonly
seen
in
aged
population
.

There
is
more
than
one
proteolytic
pathway
in
the
cell
,
and
it
has
been
reported
that
obstruction
of
any
one
of
these
pathways
may
enhance
the
activity
of
the
others
.

Proteasomal
function
has
been
found
to
have
decreased
during
aging
,
prompting
researchers
to
hypothesize
that
failure
to
remove
oxidized
proteins
may
play
an
important
role
in
aging
.

It
would
be
interesting
to
determine
the
other
proteolytic
pathways
that
are
activated
after
proteasome
inhibition
by
a
relatively
specific
inhibitor
epoxomicin
to
help
understand
their
roles
in
aging
processes

In
Alzheimer
's
disease
(
AD
)
,
early
deficits
in
learning
and
memory
are
a
consequence
of
synaptic
modification
which
are
likely
induced
by
toxic
beta
-
amyloid
oligomers
(
dAbeta
)
.

 
To
identify
molecular
targets
downstream
of
dAbeta
binding
 
we
prepared
synaptoneurosomes
from
frontal
cortex
of
control
and
IAD
patients
,
and
isolated
mRNAs
for
comparison
of
gene
expression
.

 
This
approach
elevated
synaptic
mRNAs
above
the
threshold
necessary
for
expression
changes
to
be
discriminated
and
also
reduced
other
cellular
mRNAs
.

 
In
patients
with
minimal
cognitive
impairment
(
MCI
)
termed
incipient
AD
(
IAD
)
global
measures
of
cognition
declined
with
increasing
levels
of
dimeric
beta
(
dAbeta
)
.

These
patients
also
showed
increased
expression
of
neuroplasticity
related
genes
,
many
encoding
3
'
UTR
 
consensus
sequences
that
regulate

,
displayed
elevated
mRNA
and
protein
expression
in
IAD
.

 
Other

were
also

Overexpressed
genes
may
induce

as
well
as

The

In

lymphatic
tissues
,
chronic
lymphocytic
leukemia
(
CLL
)
cells
interact
with
accessory
cells
that
constitute
the
leukemia
microenvironment
.

In
lymphatic
tissues
,
CLL
cells
are
interspersed
with
CD68
+
nurselike
cells
(

)
and
T
cells
.

However
,
the
mechanism
regulating
co

localization
of
CLL
cells
and
these
accessory
cells
are
largely
unknown
.

To
dissect
the
molecular
cross

talk
between
CLL
and
NLC
,
we
profiled
the
gene
expression
of
CD19
-
purified
CLL
cells
before
and
after
co

culture
with
NLC
.

NLC

induced
high

cell
maturation
antigen
(
BCMA
)
and
two
chemoattractants
(

by
CLL
cells
.

Supernatants
from
CLL
-
NLC
co

revealed
high
CCL3

protein
levels
.

B
cell
receptor
triggering
also
induced
a
robust
induction
of
CCL3

CCL4
expression
by
CLL
cells
,
which
was
almost
completely
abrogated
by
a
specific
Syc

,
R406
.

High
CCL3
and
CCL4
plasma
levels
in
CLL
patients
suggest
that
activation
of
this
pathway
plays
a
role
in

.

These
studies
reveal
a
novel
mechanism
of
cross
-
talk
between
CLL
cells
and
their
microenvironment
,
namely
the
secretion
of
two
T
cell
chemokines
by
CLL
-
NLC
interaction
and
in
response
to
BCR
stimulation
.

Through
these
chemokines
,
CLL
cells
can
recruit
accessory

,
and
thereby
actively
create
a
microenvironment
that
favors
their
growth

Differences
in

HbF
)
that
persists
into
adulthood
affect
the
severity

.

Genetic
association
studies
have
identified
sequence
variants
in
the
gene
BCL11A
that
influence
HbF
levels
.

Here
we
examine
BCL11A
as
a
potential
regulator
of
HbF
expression
.

The
high
HbF
BCL11A
genotype
is
associated
with
reduced
BCL11A
expression
.

Moreover
,
abundant
expression
of
full
-
length
forms
of
BCL11A
is
developmentally
restricted
to
adult
erythroid
cells
.

Down
-
regulation
of
BCL11A
expression
in
primary
adult
erythroid
cells
leads
to
robust
HbF
expression
.

Consistent
with
a
direct
role
of
BCL11A
in
globin
gene
regulation
,
we
find
that
BCL11A
occupies
several
discrete
sites
in
the
beta

globin
gene
cluster
.

BCL11A
emerges
as
a

Using

strategy
,
we
mapped
estrogen
receptor
alpha
(
ERalpha
)
binding
sites
in
MCF-7

cells
.

We
identified
1,234
high
confidence
binding
clusters
of
which
94
%
are
projected
to
be
bona

ERalpha
binding
regions
.

Only
5
%
of
the
mapped
estrogen
receptor
binding
sites
are
located
within
5
kb
upstream
of
the
transcriptional
start
sites
of
adjacent
genes
,
regions
containing
the
proximal
promoters
,
whereas
vast
majority
of
the
sites
are
mapped
to
intronic
or
distal
locations
(
>
5
kb
from
5
'
and
3
'
ends
of
adjacent
transcript
)
,
suggesting
transcriptional
regulatory
mechanisms
over
significant
physical
distances
.

Of
all
the
identified
sites
,
71
%
harbored
putative
full
estrogen
response
elements
(
EREs
)
,
25
%
bore
ERE
half
sites
,
and
only
4
%
had
no
recognizable
ERE
sequences
.

Genes
in
the
vicinity
of
ERalpha
binding
sites
were
enriched
for
regulation
by
estradiol
in
MCF-7
cells
,
and
their
expression
profiles
in
patient
samples
segregate
ERalpha
-
positive
from
ERalpha
-
negative
breast
tumors
.

The
expression
dynamics
of
the
genes
adjacent
to
ERalpha
binding
sites
suggest
a
direct
induction
of
gene
expression
through
binding
to
ERE
-
like
sequences
,
whereas
transcriptional
repression
by
ERalpha
appears
to
be
through
indirect
mechanisms
.

Our
analysis
also
indicates
a
number
of
candidate
transcription
factor
binding
sites
adjacent
to
occupied
EREs
at
frequencies
much
greater
than
by
chance
,
including
the
previously
reported
FOXA1
sites
,
and
demonstrate
the
potential
involvement
of
one
such
putative
adjacent
factor
,
Sp1
,
in
the
global
regulation
of
ERalpha

genes
.

Unexpectedly
,
we
found
that
only
22%-24
%
of
the
bona
fide
human
ERalpha
binding
sites
were
overlapping
conserved
regions
in
whole
genome
vertebrate
alignments
,
which
suggest
limited
conservation
of
functional
binding
sites
.

Taken
together
,
this

suggests
complex

definable
rules
governing
ERalpha

.

Pancreatic
cancer
is
the
fourth
leading
cause
of
cancer

.

Lack
of
early
detection
technology
for
pancreatic
cancer
invariably
leads
to
a
typical
clinical
presentation
of
incurable
disease
at

.

Oral
fluid
(
saliva
)
meets
the
demand
for
non

invasive
,
accessible
,
and
highly
efficient
diagnostic
medium
.

The
level
of
salivary
analytes
,
such
as
mRNA
and
microflora
,
vary
upon
disease
onset
;
thus
possess
valuable
signatures
for
early

and
screening
.

In
this
study
,
we
evaluated
the
performance
and
translational
utilities
of
the
salivary
transcriptomic
and
microbial
biomarkers
for
non

invasive
detection
of
early

.

Two
biomarker

were
used
to
profile

and
microflora
in

.

The
Affymetrix
Human

was
used
to
discover

.

The
Human
Oral

was
used
to
investigate
microflora

.

Biomarkers
selected
from
both
studies
were
subjected
to
an
independent
clinical

using
a
cohort
of
30
early
pancreatic
cancer
,
30
chronic

and
30

.

Two
panels
of
salivary
biomarkers
,
including
eleven
mRNA
biomarkers
and
two
microbial
biomarkers
were
discovered
and
validated
for
pancreatic
cancer
detection
.

The
logistic
regression
model
with
the
combination
of
three
mRNA
biomarkers
(
ACRV1

)
yielded
a

)
with
93.3

and
90

in
distinguishing
pancreatic
cancer
patients
from
healthy

.

The
logistic
regression
model
with
the
combination
of
two
bacterial
biomarkers
(
Neisseria

)
yielded
a

Importantly
,
the
logistic

with
the

of
four
biomarkers
(
mRNA
biomarkers
,
ACRV1
,
DMXL2
and
DPM1
;
bacterial

)
could
differentiate
pancreatic
cancer
patients
from
all
non

(
chronic

,
yielding
a
ROC

of
0.949
(
95

.

This
study
comprehensively
compared
the
salivary
transcriptome
and
microflora
between
pancreatic
cancer
and
control

.

We
have
discovered
and
validated
eleven
mRNA
biomarkers
and
two
microbial
biomarkers
for
early
detection
of
pancreatic

in
saliva
.

The
logistic
regression
model
with
four
salivary

can
detect
pancreatic

specifically
without
the
complication
of
chronic

.

This
is

Parkinson

.

Laboratory

to
interrogate
the
molecular
processes
perturbed

To
identify
the
genes
and
pathways
regulated
by
FOXF2
,
we
investigated
potential
FOXF2
gene
targets
by
microarray
analyses
of
primary
prostate
stromal
cells
(
PrSC
)
in
which
FOXF2
was
knocked
down
by
siRNA
.
190
differentially
expressed
genes
were
selected
,
of
which
104
genes
were
more
highly
expressed
in
PrSC
cells
treated
with
FOXF2
siRNA
and
86
were
more
highly
expressed
in
PRSC
cells
treated
with
negative

siRNA
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
In
each
experiment
,
we
compared
gene
expression
of
PrSC
cells
treated
with
FOXF2
siRNA
versus
PrSC
cells
treated
with
negative
control
siRNA
,
in
a
total
of
6
affymetrix

.

We
compared

in
both

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Twenty
healthy

participated
in
this
study
.

A
baseline
blood
sample
was
taken
before
the
onset
of
exercise
and
immediately
after
30

bout
.

PBMCs
were
isolated
using
OptiPrep
_
Density
Gradient
Medium
(
SIGMA
)
.

Total
RNA
was
extracted
using
TRIzol–Å.
 
cRNA
was
hybridized
onto
Affymetrix
U133
+
2

)
.

SVGR2
cells
are
glial
cells
which
are
derived
from
SVG

cells
.

They
were
created
by
subjecting
SVG
-
A
cells
to
multiple
rounds
of
lytic
infection
by
the
human
polyomavirus
JCV
.

SVGR2
cells
are
the
cells
that
survived
this
process
and
are
resistant
to
JCV
infection
.

This
experiment
was
designed
to
identify
gene
expression
differences
that
may
be
responsible
for
SVGR2
resistance
to
JCV
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
SVG
-
A
and
SVGR2
cells
are
transformed
cell
lines
.

To
eliminate
gene
expression
differences
that
may
have
occurred
due
to
genetic
instability
of
these
cell
lines
three
subclones
of
each
of
the
cell
lines
were
created
and
used
as
a
triplicate
in
the
comparison
.

Total
RNA
was
extracted
from
cells
that
had
been
left
at
100
%
confluency
for
one
day
using
the
Qiagen
RNeasy
kit
.

cDNA
was
hybridized
to
the
Affymetrix
Human
GeneChips
U133A
or
U133B
according
to
Affymetrix
gudielines
.

The
nuclear
LIM
-
only
protein
LMO4
is
upregulated
in
breast
cancer
,
especially
estrogen
receptor
negative
tumors
,
and
its
overexpression
in
mice
leads
to
hyperplasia
and
tumor
formation
.

Here
,
we
show
that
deletion
of
LMO4
in
the
mammary
glands
of
mice
leads
to
impaired
lobuloalveolar
development
due
to
decreased
epithelial
cell
proliferation
.

With
the
goal
of
discovering
potential
LMO4
-
target
genes
,
we
also
developed
a
conditional
expression
system
in
MCF-7
cells
for
both
LMO4
and
a
dominant
negative
(
DN
)
form
of
its
co
-
regulator
,
Co
-
factor
of
LIM
domains
(
Clim
/
Ldb
/
Nli
)
.

We
then
used
DNA
microarrays
to
identify
genes
responsive
to
LMO4
and
DN
-
Clim
upregulation
.

One
of
the
genes
common
to
both
datasets
was
BMP7
,
whose
expression
is
also
significantly
correlated
with
LMO4
transcript
levels
in
a
large
dataset
of
human
breast
cancers
,
suggesting
that
BMP7
is
a
bona
fide
target
gene
of
LMO4
in
breast
cancer
.

Inhibition
of
BMP7
partially
blocks
the
effects
of
LMO4
on
apoptosis
,
indicating
that
BMP7
mediates
at
least
some
functions
of
LMO4
.

Gene
transfer
studies
show
that
LMO4
regulates
the
BMP7
promoter
,
and
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
studies
show
that
LMO4
and
its
co
-
factor
Clim2
are
recruited
to
the
BMP7
promoter
.

 
Furthermore
,
we
demonstrate
that
HDAC2
recruitment
to
the
BMP7
promoter
is
inhibited
by
upregulation
of
LMO4
and
that
HDAC2
knockdown
upregulates
the
promoter
.

These
studies
suggest
a
novel
mechanism
of
action
for
LMO4
:
LMO4
,
Clim2
and
HDAC2
are
part
of
a
transcriptional
complex
,
and
increased
LMO4
levels
can
disrupt
the
complex
,
leading
to
decreased
HDAC2
recruitment
and
increased
promoter
activity
.

repressed
by
the

is
linked
to
the

.

RNA
was

.

Goal
of
this
experiment
is
the
identify
differentially

genes
in
GBM
zenografts
that
have
been
exposed
to
Cilengitide
for
1
or
8

A

is
also
included
.

 
None
of
the

:
4

are
used
as
a

for
expression
with

The
Wilms
'
tumor
1
gene
(
WT1
)
encodes
a
transcription
factor
involved
in
cell
growth
and
development
.

As
we
previously
reported
WT1
expression
is
hardly
detectable
in
normal
hepatic
tissue
but
is
induced
in
liver
cirrhosis
.

Although
WT1
has
been
found
to
be
overexpressed
in
a
number
of
malignancies
,
the
role
of
WT1
in
hepatocarcinogenesis
has
not
been
clarified
.

We
found
that
WT1
is
expressed
in
several
human
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
cell
lines
including
PLC
/
PRF/5
and
HepG2
,
and
in
HCC
tumor
tissue
in
42
%
of
patients
.

WT1
small
interfering
RNAs
did
not
affect
proliferation
rate
of
HCC
cells
but
abrogated
their
resistance
to
anoikis
.

Transcriptome
analysis
of
PLC
/
PRF/5
cells
after
WT1
knockdown
demonstrated
upregulation
of
251
genes
and
downregulation
of
321
.

Ninety
per
cent
of
the
former
corresponded
to
metabolic
genes
mostly
those
characterizing
the
mature
hepatocyte
phenotype
.

On
the
contrary
,
genes
that
decreased
upon
WT1
inhibition
were
mainly
related
to
defense
against
apoptosis
,
cell
cycle
and
tumor
progression
.

In
agreement
with
these
findings
WT1
expression
increased
the
resistance
of
liver
tumor
cells
to
doxorubicin
,
a
compound
used
to
treat
HCC
.

Interestingly
,
doxorubicin
strongly
enhanced
WT1
expression
in
both
HCC
cells
and
normal
human
hepatocytes
.

Among
different
chemotherapeutics
,
induction
of
WT1
transcription
was
restricted
to
topoisomerase
2
inhibitors
.

When
WT1
expression
was
prohibited
doxorubicin
caused
a
marked
increase
in
caspase-3
activation
.

In
conclusion
,
WT1
is
expressed
in
a
substantial
proportion
of
HCC
contributing
to
tumor
progression
and
resistance
to
chemotherapy
,
suggesting
that
WT1
may
be
an
important
target
for
HCC
treatment
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
describe
the
gene
expression
patterns
related
to
the
differentiation
and
mineralization
of
bone
-
forming
cells
,
including
activation
and/or
repression
of
osteogenic
or
non
-
osteogenic
pathways
,
remodeling
of
cell
architecture
,
cell
adhesion
,
cell
communication
,
and
assembly
of
extracellular
matrix
.

The
study
implied
patient
selection
,
tissue
collection
,
isolation
and
culture
of
human
marrow
stromal
cells
(
hMSC
)
and
osteoblasts
(
hOB
)
,
and
characterization
of
bone
-
forming
cells
.

RNA
samples
were
collected
at
defined
time
points
,
in
order
to
understand
the
regulation
of
gene
expression
during
the
processes
of
cell
differentiation
/
mineralization
that
occur
during
bone
repair
.

Transcriptome
analysis
was
performed
by
using
the
Affymetrix
GeneChip
microarray
technology
platform
and
GeneChip–≤‚Ç¨—ô–ì_–ì‚Ä†
Human

.

Our
results
help
to
design
a
gene
expression
profile
of
bone
-
forming
cells
during
specific
steps
of
osteogenic
differentiation
.

These
findings
offer
an
useful
tool
to
monitor
the
behaviour
of
osteogenic
precursors
cultured
in
presence
of
exogenous
stimuli
,
i.e.
growth
factors
,
or
onto
3D
scaffolds
for
bone
engineering
.

Moreover
,
they
can
contribute
to
identify
and
clarify
the
role
of
new
genes
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
regulating
osteogenesis
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
hMSC
were
derived
from
mononuclear
cells
(
MNC
)
of
bone
marrow
aspirates
of
four
patients
.

MNC
cultures
were
maintained
in
differentiation
medium
containing
ascorbic
acid-2
phosphate
and
dexamethasone
,
and
hMSC
were
collected
at
different
time
points
.

The
experimental
protocol
was
specifically
devised
to
mark
five
steps
of
hMSC
differentiation
(
MD
)
.

The
reference
sample
consisted
in
MNCs
before
the
addition
of
differentiation
medium
(
MD1
)
.

The
species
Staphylococcus
(
S.
)
aureus
harbors
19
superantigen
gene
loci
,
six
of
which
are
located
in
the
enterotoxin
gene
cluster
(
egc
)
.

While
these
egc
superantigens
are
far
more
prevalent
in
clinical
S.
aureus
isolates
than
non
-
egc
superantigens
,
they
are
not
a
prominent
cause
of
toxic
shock
.

Moreover
,
neutralizing
antibodies
against
egc
superantigens
are
very
rare
,
even
among
carriers
of
egc
-
positive
S.
aureus
strains
.

In
search
of
an
explanation
we
have
tested
two
non
-
exclusive
hypotheses
:
1
)
egc
and
non
-
egc
superantigens
have
unique
intrinsic
properties
and
drive
the
immune
system
into
different
directions
;
2
)
egc
and
non
-
egc
-
superantigens
are
released
by
S.
aureus
under
different
conditions
,
which
shape
the
immune
response
.

A
comparison
of
three
egc
(
SEI
,
SElM
and
SElO
)
and
three
non
-
egc
superantigens
(
SEB
,
SElQ
,
TSST-1
)
revealed
that
both
induced
proliferation
of
human
PBMC
with
comparable
potency
and
elicited
similar
Th1
/
Th2
-
cytokine
signatures
.

This
was
supported
by
gene
expression
analysis
of
PBMC
stimulated
with
one
representative
superantigen
from
each
group
(
SEI
and
SEB
)
.

They
induced
very
similar
transcriptional
changes
,
especially
of
inflammation
-
associated
gene
networks
,
corresponding
to
a
very
strong
Th1-
and
Th17
-
dominated
immune
response
.

In
contrast
,
the
regulation
of
superantigen
release
differed
markedly
between
both
superantigen
groups
.

Egc
-
encoded
proteins
were
secreted
by
S.
aureus
during
exponential
growth
,
while
non
-
egc
superantigens
were
released
in
the
stationary
phase
.

We
conclude
that
the
distinct
biological
behavior
of
egc
and
non
-
egc
superantigens
is
not
due
to
their
intrinsic
properties
,
which
are
very
similar
,
but
caused
by
their
differential
release
by
S.
aureus
.

Experiment

PBMCs
from

were
purified

was
extracted
and
hybridized

In
this

,
we
have
investigated
the
effect
of
LMP1
on
gene
expression
in
normal
human
GC
B

using
a
non

:
Gene

was

.

RNA
from
the
FACS

was
amplified
.

10ug
of
fragmented
cRNA
was
hybridized
to
HG
-
U133
Plus
2.0
microarrays
.

Differentially
expressed
genes
were
identified
using
significance
analysis
of
microarrays
(
SAM
)
with
a
1.5
fold
change
threshold
and
the
q

threshold
set
to
5
%
.

The
regulatory
subunit
of
cAMP
-
dependent
protein
kinase
(
PKA
)
exists
in
two
isoforms
,
RI
and
RII
,
which
distinguish
the
PKA
isozymes
,
type
I
(
PKA
-
I
)
and
type
II
(
PKA
-
II
)
.

Evidence
obtained
from
a
variety
of
different
experimental
approaches
has
shown
that
the
relative
levels
of
type
I
and
type
II
PKA
in
cells
can
play
a
major
role
in
determining
the
balance
between
cell
growth
and
differentiation
.

RI
?

transfected
cells
exhibit
hyper
-
proliferative
growth
and
RII
?

transfected
cells
revert
to
a
relatively
quiescent
state
.

Profiling
by
microarray
revealed
equally
profound
changes
in
gene
expression
between
RI

,
RII
?
,
and
parental
OVCAR
cells
.

Dendritic
cells
differentiate
from
their
precursors
in
the
airway
mucosa
under
local
environmental
instruction
.

 
Airway
epithelial
cells
(
AEC
)
are
a
potent
source
of
both
pro-
and
anti
-
inflammatory
mediators
and
are
in
intimate
contact
with
intraepithelial
DC
and
their
precursors
.

Thus
,
AEC
are
likely
candidates
for
influencing
this
differentiation
process
in
order
to
tailor
the
DC
for
optimal
function
in
the
airway
mucosa
.

We
used
Affymetirx

Title
:
Transcriptome

of
human
endometrial
tissues
from
healthy
post

menoupausal
women
reflecting
the
endometrial
response
to
3
-
weeks
treatment
with
tibolone
,
E2
and
E2+MPA
.

 
In
an
observational
,
open
,
non

,
controlled
study
uterine
tissues
were
collected
in
order
to
generate
endometrial
gene

.

healthy
postmenopausal

were
enrolled
into
the
following
treatment
groups
:
Control
-
group
;
Tibolone
-
group
,
2,5
mg
of
tibolone
(
administered
orally
)
every
day
,
starting
21
days
prior
to
surgery
;
Estradiol
-
group
,
2
mg
of
estradiol
(
administered
orally
)
every
day
,
starting
21
days
prior
to
surgery
;
Estradiol+progestagen
-
group
,
2
mg
of
estradiol
(
administered
orally
)
and
5
mg
of
MPA
(
Medroxy
Progesteroneacetate
,
administered
orally
)
every
day
,
starting
21
days
prior
to
surgery
.

Pure
(
100
%
)
endometrium
was
isolated
from
the
snap
-
frozen
uterine
tissues
and
used
for
RNA
isolation
.

RNA
was
labbeled
and
hybridized
to
whole
genome

Affymetrix
U133plus2
GeneChips
containing
54,614
probe
sets
,
representing
approximately
47,000
transcripts
.

 
Relative
to
the
control
group
,
940
genes
are
regulated
in
the
endometrium
of
E2
treated
patients
,
whereas
only
198
genes
are
significantly
regulated
in
endometria
from
tibolone
or
E2+MPA
treated
patients
.

Furthermore
,
only
9
%
of
E2
regulated
genes
are
also
regulated
by
tibolone
(
85
out
of
940
)
,
only
5
%
are
also
regulated
by
E2+MPA
treatment
and
the
overlap
between
tibolone
and
E2+MPA
treatment
is
about
10
%
.

This
indicated
that
tibolone
-
treatment
results
in
a
weak
endometrial
profile
similarity
to
E2
treatment
and
no
profile
similarity
to
E2+MPA
treatment
.

A
more
detailed
analysis
showed
that
down
stream
processes
,
such
as
regulation
of
the
cell
cycle
,
angiogenesis
and
cell
proliferation
are
almost
not
affected
by
tibolone
treatment
but
,
in
contrast
,
are
significantly
affected
by
E2
.

For
example
,
upon
staining
with
Ki67
,
a
marker
for
mitotic
activity
,
significantly
increased
stromal
as
well
as
glandular
cell
proliferation
was
observed
in
the
endometria
from
the
E2
-
only
treated
group
,
while
tibolone
treatment
resulted
only
in
a
slight
increase
in
stromal
cell
proliferation
(
and
no
increase
in
glandular
cell
proliferation
)
.

These
results
indicate
that
in
contrast
to
long
-
term
tibolone
use
,
short
-
term
(
21
-
days
)
use
results
in
some
estrogenic
stimulation
of
the
endometrium
,
which
is
clearly
far
less
and
rather
different
from
what
is
observed
during
E2
treatment
.

,
which
both
signal
through

to
stimulate

,
with

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Two
treatment
groups
with
four
tumor
samples
per
group
are
collected
and
analyzed
,

OBJECTIVE
:
To
determine
whether
macrophages
,
a
type
of
cell
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
ankylosing
spondylitis
(
AS
)
,
exhibit
a
characteristic
gene
expression
pattern
.

METHODS
:

Macrophages
were
derived
from
the
peripheral
blood
of
8
AS
patients
(
median
disease
duration
13
years
[
range
<
1
-
43
years
]
)
and
9
healthy
control
subjects
over
7
days
with
the
use
of
granulocyte
-
macrophage
colony
-
stimulating
factor
.

Cells
were
stimulated
for
24
hours
with
interferon
-
gamma
(
IFNgamma
;
100
units
/
ml
)
,
were
left
untreated
for
24
hours
,
or
were
treated
for
3
hours
with
lipopolysaccharide
(
LPS
;
10
ng
/
ml
)
.

RNA
was
isolated
and
examined
by
microarray
and
real
-
time
quantitative
reverse
transcription
-
polymerase
chain
reaction
analysis
.

RESULTS
:

Microarray
analysis
revealed
198
probe
sets
detecting
the
differential
expression
of
141
unique
genes
in
untreated
macrophages
from
AS
patients
compared
with
healthy
controls
.

Clustering
and
principal
components
analysis
clearly
distinguished
AS
patients
and
controls
.

Of
the
differentially
expressed
genes
,
78
(
55
%
)
were
IFN
-
regulated
,
and
their
relative
expression
indicated
a
reverse
IFN
signature
in
AS
patient
macrophages
,
where
IFNgamma
-
up
-
regulated
genes
were
underexpressed
and
down
-
regulated
genes
were
overexpressed
.

Treatment
of
macrophages
with
exogenous
IFNgamma
normalized
the
expression
of
these
genes
between
patients
and
controls
.

In
addition
,
the
messenger
RNA
encoded
by
the
IFNgamma
gene
was
approximately
2
-
fold
lower
in
AS
patient
macrophages
at
baseline
(
P
=
0.004
)
and
was
poorly
responsive
to
LPS
(
P
=
0.018
)
,
as
compared
with
healthy
controls
.

CONCLUSIONS
:

Our
findings
reveal
consistent
differences
in
gene
expression
in
macrophages
from
AS
patients
,
with
evidence
of
a
striking
reverse
IFN
signature
.

Together
with
poor
expression
and
responsiveness
of
the
IFNgamma
gene
,
these
results
suggest
that
there
may
be
a
relative
defect
in
IFNgamma
gene
regulation
,
with
autocrine
consequences
and
implications
for
disease
pathogenesis
.

Purpose
:
 
Evaluate
gene
expression
profiles
after
inducing
differentiation
in
cultured
interstitial
cystitis
(
IC
)
and
control
urothelial
cells
.

Materials
and
Methods
:
 
Bladder
biopsies
were
taken
from
IC
patients
and
controls
(
women
having
surgery
for
stress
incontinence
)
.

 
Primary
cultures
were
grown
in
Keratinocyte
Growth
Medium
with
supplements
.

 
To
induce
differentiation
,
in
some
plates
the
medium
was
changed
to
DMEM
-
F12
with
supplements
.

 
RNA
was
analyzed
with
Affymetrix
chips
.

 
Three
nonulcer
IC
patients
were
compared
with
three
controls
.

Results
:
 
After
inducing
differentiation
,
302
genes
with
a
described
function
were
altered
at
least
3
-
fold
with
p
<
0.01
in
both
IC
and
control
cells
.

 
Functions
of
the162
upregulated
genes
included
cell
adhesion
(
e.g.
claudins
,
occludin
,
cingulin
)
;
urothelial
differentiation
,
retinoic
acid
pathway
and
keratinocyte
differentiation
(
e.g.
skin
cornified
envelope
components
)
.

 
The
140
downregulated
genes
included
genes
associated
with
basal
urothelium
(
e.g.
 
p63
,
integrins
?
4
,
?
5
and
?
6
,
basonuclin
1
and
extracellular
matrix
components
)
,
vimentin
,
metallothioneins
and
members
of
the
Wnt
and
Notch
pathways
.

 
Comparing
IC
vs.
control
cells
after
differentiation
,
only
seven
genes
with
a
described
function
were
altered
at
least
3
-
fold
with
p
<
0.01
.

 
PI3
,
SERPINB4
,
CYP2C8
,
EFEMP2
and
SEPP1
were
decreased
in
IC
;
AKR1C2
and
MKNK1
were
increased
in
IC
.

Conclusions
:
 
Differentiation
-
associated
changes
occurred
in
both
IC
and
control
cells
.

Comparing
IC
vs.
control
revealed
very
few
differences
.

 
This
study
may
have
included
IC
patients
with
minimal
urothelial
deficiency
and/or
selected
the
cells
that
were
most
robust
in
culture
.

 
Also
,
the
abnormal
urothelium
in
IC
may
be
due
to
post
-
translational
changes
and/or
the
bladder
environment
.

were
identified
by
transcript
profiling
of

cancer
cells
.

The
gene
expression
profile
generated
after
estrogen
treatment
was
compared
with
that
following
inducible

of
c

Myc
or
c

(
a

)
in

.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:

RNA
was
collected
in
three
independent
experiments
,
each
including
parental
MCF-7

treated
with
17b

(

)
or

)
,

and
zinc

)
cells
.

Cells
were
arrested
for
48
h
with
10
nM
ICI
182780
and
then
treated
for
6
h
with
either
100
nM
E2
or
ethanol
vehicle
,
or
75
mM
zinc
for
the
stably

lines
.

Background
:
While
BMPR2
mutation
strongly
predisposes
to
pulmonary
arterial
hypertension
(
PAH
)
,
only
20
%
of
mutation
carriers
develop
clinical
disease
.

This
finding
suggests
that
modifier
genes
contribute
to
FPAH
clinical
expression
.

Since
modifiers
are
likely
to
be
common
alleles
,
this
problem
is
not
tractable
by
traditional
genetic
approaches
.

Further
,
examination
of
gene
expression
is
complicated
by
confounding
effects
attributable
to
drugs
and
the
disease
process
itself
.

Methods
:
To
resolve
these
problems
,
B
-
cells
were
isolated
,
EBV
-
immortalized
,
and
cultured
from
familial
PAH
patients
with
BMPR2
mutations
,
mutation
positive
but
disease
-
free
family
members
,
and
family
members
without
mutation
.

This
allows
examination
of
differences
in
gene
expression
without
drug
or
disease
-
related
effects
.

These
differences
were
assayed
by
Affymetrix
array
,
with
follow
-
up
by
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
and
additional
statistical
analyses
.

Results
:

By
gene
array
,
we
found
consistent
alterations
in
multiple

.

Selected
genes
were
verified
by
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
using
a
larger

set
.

Analysis
of
overrepresented

suggests
that
it
is
pathway
-

-
specific
changes
that
carry
increased

.

Conclusions
:
B

are
a
valuable
and
accessible
tool
for
assaying
alterations
in
gene
expression
free
from

.

Predisposition
to
disease
within
BMPR2

carriers
was
linked
to

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
describe
the
gene
expression
patterns
related
to
the
differentiation
and
mineralization
of
bone
-
forming
cells
,
including
activation
and/or
repression
of
osteogenic
or
non
-
osteogenic
pathways
,
remodeling
of
cell
architecture
,
cell
adhesion
,
cell
communication
,
and
assembly
of
extracellular
matrix
.

The
study
implied
patient
selection
,
tissue
collection
,
isolation
and
culture
of
human
marrow
stromal
cells
(
hMSC
)
and
osteoblasts
(
hOB
)
,
and
characterization
of
bone
-
forming
cells
.

RNA
samples
were
collected
at
defined
time
points
,
in
order
to
understand
the
regulation
of
gene
expression
during
the
processes
of
cell
differentiation
/
mineralization
that
occur
during
bone
repair
.

Transcriptome
analysis
was
performed
by
using
the
Affymetrix
GeneChip
microarray
technology
platform
and
GeneChip
Human
Genome
U133
Plus
2.0
Array
.

Our
results
help
to
design
a
gene
expression
profile
of
bone
-
forming
cells
during
specific
steps
of
osteogenic
differentiation
.

These
findings
offer
an
useful
tool
to
monitor
the
behaviour
of
osteogenic
precursors
cultured
in
presence
of
exogenous
stimuli
,
i.e.
growth
factors
,
or
onto
3D
scaffolds
for
bone
engineering
.

Moreover
,
they
can
contribute
to
identify
and
clarify
the
role
of
new
genes
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
regulating
osteogenesis
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Differentiated
osteoblasts
(
hOB
)
were
obtained
from
trabecular
bone
fragments
of
four
patients
.

hOB
cultures
were
maintained
in
mineralization
medium
containing
beta
-
glycerophosphate
,
and
collected
at
different
time
points
.

The
experimental
protocol
was
specifically
devised
to
mark
four
steps
of
hOB
mineralization
(
HM
)
.

The
reference
sample
consisted
in
confluent
hOBs
before
the
addition
of
mineralization
medium
(
HM1
)
.

Background
:
To
evaluate
the
impact
of
the
duration
of
chronic
inflammation
on
gene
expression
in
skeletal
muscle
biopsies
(
MBx
)
from
untreated
children
with
juvenile
dermatomyositis
(
JDM
)
and
identify
genes
and
biological
processes
associated
with
the
disease
progression
,
expression
profiling
data
from
16
girls
with
active
symptoms
of
JDM
greater
or
equal
to
2
months
were
compared
with
3
girls
with
active
symptoms
less
than
2
months
.

Results
:
Seventy
-
nine
genes
were
differentially
expressed
between
the
groups
with
long
or
short
duration
of
untreated
disease
.

 
Genes
involved
in
immune
responses
and
vasculature
remodeling
were
expressed
at
a
higher
level
in
muscle
biopsies
from
children
with
greater
or
equal
to
2
months
of
symptoms
,
while
genes
involved
in
stress
responses
and
protein
turnover
were
expressed
at
a
lower
level
.

 
Among
the
79
genes
,
expression
of
9
genes
showed
a
significant
linear
regression
relationship
with
the
duration
of
untreated
disease
.

 
Five
differentially
expressed
genes
--
HLA
-
DQA1
,
smooth
muscle
myosin
heavy
chain
,
clustering
,
plexin
D1
and
tenomodulin
--
were
verified
by
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
.

 
The
chronic
inflammation
of
longer
disease
duration
was
also
associated
with
increased
DC
-
LAMP+
and
BDCA2
+
mature
dendritic
cells
,
identified
by
immunohistochemistry
.

Conclusions
:
We
conclude
that
chronic
inflammation
alters
the
gene
expression
patterns
in
muscle
of
untreated
children
with
JDM
.

 
Symptoms
lasting
greater
or
equal
to
2
months
were
associated
with
dendritic
cell
maturation
and
anti
-
angiogenic
vascular
remodelling
,
directly
contributing
to
disease
pathophysiology
.

Experiment
Overall

Objective
.

Meningococcal
sepsis
remains
an
important
cause
of
childhood
morbidity
and
mortality
.

Largely
due
to
logistic
complexities
of
research
in
young
children
with
acute
life
-
threatening
disease
,
very
little
is
known
regarding
differential
expression
kinetics
and
molecular
regulation
of
immune
response
genes
in
leukocyte
subsets
.

 
Materials
and
methods
.

In
this
prospective
case
-
control
study
,
six
children
with
meningococcal
sepsis
were
included
.

Blood
was
drawn
at
four
time
points
(
t=0
,
t=8
,
t=24
and
t=72
h
after
admission
to
the
paediatric
intensive
care
unit
)
.

Blood
was
also
collected
from
matched
controls
.

Detailed
immunophenotyping
of
leukocytes
was
performed
;
RNA
isolated
from
whole
blood
,
lymphocytes
,
monocytes
,
and
granulocytes
was
used
to
perform
Affymetrix
micro
-
array
gene
expression
analysis
.

Results
and
conclusion
.

There
were
no
differences
in
total
leukocyte
count
between
patients
and
controls
.

In
contrast
to
previous
in
vitro
studies
we
observed
an
unexpected
decrease
in
NK
cell
numbers
,
as
well
as
downregulation
of
NK
cell
specific
and
cytotoxic
T
-
cell
related
gene
expression
in
patients
with
meningococcal
septic
shock
.

By
contrast
,
expression
of
genes
,
involved
in
innate
immunity
and
several
other
pathways
,
differed
between
the
different
leukocyte
subpopulations
in
a
dynamic
fashion
.

Compared
to
previously
reported
gene
expression
profiles
,
it
was
possible
to
define
a
meningococcal
sepsis
specific
expression
profile
.

TMPRSS6
is
a
type
II
transmembrane
serine
protease
and
is
revealed
by
our
work
to
be
part
of
a
low
-
iron
sensing
pathway
.

When
animal
gets
iron
deficient
,
TMPRSS6
is
required
to
shut
off
hepcidin
gene
,
so
as
to
allow
iron
to
be
uptaken
from
GI
tract
.

The
mutant
mouse
,
which
was
generated
by
ENU
mutagenesis
,
has
developed
microcytic
anemia
.

The
phenotype
is
caused
by
a
splicing
error
in
Tmprss6
gene
.

However
,
the
mechanism
of
TMPRSS6
effect
remains
elusive
.

To
gain
further
insight
into
the
molecular
components
of
the
TMPRSS6
signaling
pathway
,
we
overexpressed
either
TMPRSS6
or
its
mutant
version
of
protein
in
human
liver
carcinoma
cell
line
HepG2
cells
,
and
compared
the
transcription
status
betweem
these
two
treatments
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Triplicate
per
transfection
with
wildtype
Tmprss6
cDNA
,
mutant
version
of
Tmprss6
cDNA
and
empty

,
respectively
.

Cyclin
T1
-
dependent
genes
in
PMA
-
activated
MM6
cells
.

HIV-1
is
dependent
upon
cellular
co
-
factors
to
mediate
its
replication
cycle
in
CD4
+
T
cells
and
macrophages
,
the
two
major
cell
types
infected
by
the
virus
in
vivo
.

 
One
critical
co
-
factor
is
Cyclin
T1
,
a
subunit
of
a
general
RNA
polymerase
II
elongation
factor
known
as
P
-
TEFb
.

 
Cyclin
T1
is
targeted
directly
by
the
viral
Tat
protein
to
activate
proviral
transcription
.

 
Cyclin
T1
is
up
-
regulated
when
resting
CD4
+
T
cells
are
activated
and
during
macrophage
differentiation
or
activation
,
conditions
that
are
also
necessary
for
high
levels
of
HIV-1
replication
.

 
Because
Cyclin
T1
is
a
subunit
of
a
transcription
factor
,
the
up
-
regulation
of
Cyclin
T1
in
these
cells
results
in
the
induction
of
cellular
genes
,
some
of
which
might
be
HIV-1
co
-
factors
.

 
Using
shRNA
depletions
of
Cyclin
T1
and
transcriptional
profiling
,
we
identified
54
cellular
mRNAs
that
are
Cyclin
T1
-
dependent
for
their
induction
in
activated
CD4
+
T
cells
and
during
macrophage
differentiation
and
activation
.

 
The
promoters
for
these
Cyclin
T1
-
dependent
genes
(
CTDGs
)
are
over
-
represented
in
two
transcription
factor
binding
sites
,
SREBP1
and
ARP1
.

 
Notably
,
10
of
these
CTDGs
have
been
reported
to
be
involved
in
HIV-1
replication
,
a
significant
over
-
representation
of
such
genes
when
compared
to
randomly
generated
lists
of
54
genes
(
p
value
<
0.00021
)
.

 
SiRNA
depletions
of
two
CTDGs
identified
here
,
CDK11
and
Casein
kinase1gamma1
,
suggest
that
these
genes
are
also
involved
in
HIV-1
replication
.

 
It
is
therefore
likely
that
the
54
CTDGs
identified
here
include
novel
HIV-1
co
-
factors
.

 
The
presence
of
CTDGs
in
the
protein
space
that
was
available
for
HIV-1
to
sample
during
its
evolution
and
acquisition
of
Tat
function
may
provide
an
explanation
for
why
CTDGs
are
enriched
in
viral
co
-
factors
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Using
shRNA
knockdown
of
cyclin
T1
,
cyclin
T1
-
dependent
genes
were
identified
in
PMA

activated
MM6

Carcinoma
associated
fibroblasts
(
CAFs
)
have
recently
been
implicated
in
important
aspects
of
epithelial
solid
tumor
biology
such
as
neoplastic
progression
,
tumor
growth
,
angiogenesis
,
and
metastasis
.

However
,
neither
the
source
of
CAFs
nor
the
differences
between
CAFs
and
fibroblasts
from
non
-
neoplastic
tissue
have
been
well
defined
.

In
this
study
we
demonstrate
that
human
bone
marrow
-
derived
mesenchymal
stem
cells
(
hMSCs
)
exposed
to
tumor
-
conditioned
medium
(
TCM
)
over
a
prolonged
period
of
time
assume
a
CAF
-
like
myofibroblastic
phenotype
.

More
importantly
,
these
cells
exhibit
functional
properties
of
CAFs
including
sustained
expression
of
stromal
derived
factor
1
(
SDF-1
)
and
the
ability
to
promote
tumor
cell
growth
both
in
vitro
and
in
an
in
vivo
co
-
implantation
model
and
expression
of
myofibroblast
markers
including
alpha
-
smooth
muscle
actin
and
fibroblast
surface
protein
.

hMSCs
induced
to
differentiate
to
a
myofibroblast
-
like
phenotype
using
5
-
azacytidine
do
not
promote
tumor
cells
growth
as
efficiently
as
hMSCs
cultured
in
tumor
-
conditioned
medium
nor
do
they
demonstrate
increased
SDF-1
expression
.

Furthermore
,
gene
expression
profiling
revealed
similarities
between
TCM
exposed
hMSCs
and
carcinoma
associated
fibroblasts
.

Taken
together
these
data
suggest
that
hMSCs
are
a
source
of
carcinoma
associated
fibroblasts
and
can
be
used
in
the
modeling
of
tumor
-
stroma
interactions
.

To
our
knowledge
this
is
the
first
report
demonstrating
that
hMSCs
become
activated
and
resemble
carcinoma
associated
myofibroblasts
upon
prolonged
exposure
to
conditioned
medium
from
MDAMB231
human
breast
cancer
cells
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
The
experiment
was
done
to
test
the
differentiation
of
hMSCs
upon
exposure
to
tumor
condition
media
or
epigenetic
modifiers
.

Mononuclear
phagocytes
play
an
important
role
in
the
removal
of
apoptotic
cells
by
expressing
cell
surface
receptors
that
recognize
and
remove
apoptotic
cells
.

Based
on
the
knowledge
that
cigarette
smoking
is
associated
with
increased
lung
cell
turnover
,
we
hypothesized
that
alveolar
macrophages
(
AM
)
of
normal
cigarette
smokers
may
exhibit
enhanced
expression
of
apoptotic
cell
removal
receptor
genes
.

AM
obtained
by
bronchoalveolar
lavage
of
normal
non
-
smokers
(
n=11
)
and
phenotypic
normal
smokers
(
n=13
,
36
+
/-
6
pack
per
year
)
were
screened
for
mRNA
expression
of
all
known
apoptotic
cell
removal
receptors
using
Affymetrix
HG
-
U133
Plus
2.0
chips
with
TaqMan
RT
-
PCR
confirmation
.

Of
the
14
known
apoptotic
receptors
expressed
,
only
MER
Tyrosine
Kinase
(
MERTK
)
,
a
transmembrane
tyrosine
kinase
receptor
,
was
significantly
up
-
regulated
in
smokers
.

MERTK
expression
was
then
assessed
in
AM
of
smokers
vs
nonsmokers
by
TaqMan
RT
-
PCR
,
immunohistochemistry
,
Western
and
flow
analysis
.

Smoker
AM
had
up
-
regulation
of
MERTK
mRNA
levels
(
smoker
vs
non
-
smoker
,
3.6
-
fold
by
microarray
,
p<0.003
;
9.5
-
fold
by
TaqMan
RT
-
PCR
,
p<0.02
)
.

Immunohistochemistry
demonstrated
a
qualitative
increase
in
MERTK
protein
expression
on
AM
of
smokers
.

Increased
protein
expression
of
MERTK
on
AM
of
smokers
was
confirmed
by
Western
and
flow
analyses
(
p
<
0.007
and
p
<
0.0002
,
respectively
)
.

MERTK
,
a
cell
surface
receptor
that
recognizes
apoptotic
cells
,
is
expressed
on
human
AM
,
and
its
expression
is
up
-
regulated
in
AM
of
cigarette
smokers
.

This
may
reflect
an
increased
demand
for
removal
of
apoptotic
cells
in
smokers
,
an
observation
with
implications
for
the
development
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(
COPD
)
,
a
disorder
associated
with
dysregulated
apoptosis
of
lung
parenchymal
cells
.

Trovafloxacin
is
a
broad

antibiotic
that
inhibits
the
uncoiling
of
supercoiled
DNA
in
various
bacteria
by
blocking
the
activity
of
DNA
gyrase
and
topoisomerase
IV
.

Specific
members
of
this
drug
family
display
high
activity
against
eukaryotic
type
II
topoisomerase
,
as
well
as
cultured
mammalian
cells
and
in

.

Trovafloxacin
seems
to
have
a
higher
affinity
for
eukaryotic
polymerase
II
system
than
the
other
quinolone
agents
tested
.

This
effect
coupled
with

such
as
an

,
might
result
in

In
recent
years
,
several
approaches
have
been
taken
in
the
peptide
-
based
immunotherapy
of
metastatic
renal
cell
carcinoma
(
RCC
)
,
although
little
is
known
about
HLA
presentation
on
metastases
compared
to
primary
tumor
and
normal
tissue
of
RCC
.

In
this
study
we
compared
primary
tumor
,
normal
tissue
and
metastases
with
the
aim
of
identifying
similarities
and
differences
between
these
tissues
.

We
performed
this
comparison
for
two
RCC
patients
on
the
level
of
the
HLA
ligandome
using
mass
spectrometry
and
for
three
patients
on
the
level
of
the
transcriptome
using
oligonucleotide
microarrays
.

The
quantitative
results
show
that
primary
tumor
is
more
similar
to
metastasis
than
to
normal
tissue
,
both
on
the
level
of
HLA
ligand
presentation
and
mRNA
.

We
were
able
to
characterize
a
total
of
142
peptides
in
the
qualitative
analysis
of
HLA
-
presented
peptides
.

Six
of
them
were
significantly
overpresented
on
metastasis
,
among
them
a
peptide
derived
from
CD151
;
fourteen
were
overpresented
on
both
primary
tumor
and
metastasis
compared
to
normal
tissue
,
among
them
an
HLA
ligand
derived
from
tumor
protein
p53
.

Thus
,
we
could
demonstrate
that
peptide
-
based
immunotherapy
might
affect
tumor
as
well
as
metastasis
of
RCC
,
but
not
healthy
kidney
tissue
.

Furthermore
we
were
able
to
identify
several
peptides
derived
from
tumor
-
associated
antigens
that
are
suitable
for
vaccination
of
metastatic
RCC
.

Three

To
begin
to
address
how
HCMV
induces
these
rapid
changes
in
infected
monocytes
,
we
examined
the
transcriptome
of
infected

revealed
a
significant
number
of
pro

were
upregulated
within

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
To
begin
to
globally
define
the
HCMV
-
induced
changes
in
monocyte
function
,
we
performed
a
transcriptome
analysis
.

 
Specifically
,
a

unique
probe

was
utilized
to
assess
the
modulation
of

.

 
A
total
of
6
replicates
from
mock

infected
and
6
replicates
from
HCMV
-
infected
monocytes
were
analyzed
in
this
study
.

Rationale
:
 
We
previously
generated
genome
-
wide
expression
data
in
children
with
septic
shock
,
based
on
whole
blood
-
derive
RNA
,
having
the
potential
to
lead
the
field
into
novel
areas
of
investigation
.

Objective
:
 
Herein
we
seek
to
validate
our
data
through
a
bioinformatic
approach
centered
on
a
validation
patient
cohort
.

Methods
:
 
Microarray-
and
bioinformatics
-
centered
analyses
involving
our
previous
data
as
a
training
data
set
(
n
=
42
)
and
a
new
,
validation
cohort
(
n
=

)
as
the
test
data
set
.

 
Measurements

Main
Results
:
 
Class
prediction
modeling
using
the
training
data
set
and
the
previously
reported
genome
-
wide
expression
signature
of
pediatric
septic
shock
correctly
identified
93
to
100
%
of
septic
shock
patients
in
the
test
data
set
,
depending
on
the
class
prediction
algorithm
and
the
gene
selection
method
.

Subjecting
the
test
data
set
to
an
identical
filtering
strategy
as
that
used
for
the
training
data
set
,
demonstrated
72
%
concordance
between
the
two
gene
lists
.

Subjecting
the
test
data
set
to
a
purely
statistical
filtering
strategy
,
with
highly
stringent
correction
for
multiple
comparisons
,
demonstrated
less
than
50
%
concordance
with
the
previous
gene
filtering
strategy
.

However
,
functional
analysis
of
this
statistics
-
based
gene
list
demonstrated
similar
functional
annotations
and
signaling
pathways
as
that
seen
in
the
learning
data
set
.

In
particular
,
we
validated
that
pediatric
septic
shock
is
characterized
by
large
scale
repression
of
genes
related
to
zinc
homeostasis
and
lymphocyte
function
.

 
Conclusions
:
 
These
data
demonstrate
that
the
previously
reported
genome
-
wide
expression
signature
of
pediatric
septic
shock
is
applicable
to
a
validation
cohort
of
patients

.

We
sought
to
identify
alterations
in

of
human

.

Human

were
infected
with
G207
,
an

.

G207

.

A
gene

contained
7
genes
known
to
be

We
hypothesized
that
exercise
would
activate
neutrophil
genes
involved
in
apoptosis
,
inflammation
,
and
cell
growth
and
repair
,
since
these

of
526
genes
were

316
genes
had
higher

.

The

,
known
to
inhibit
apoptosis
,
was
significantly
activated
(

,
but
14
genes
were
altered

Finally
,
a
number
of
neutrophil
genes
known
to
be
involved
in
pathological
conditions
like
asthma
and
arthritis
were
altered
by
exercise
,
suggesting
novel
links
between
physical
activity
and
disease
or
its
prevention
.

 
In
summary
,
brief
heavy
exercise
leads
to
a
previously
unknown
substantial
and
significant
alteration
in
neutrophil
gene
expression
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Twelve
healthy
men
(
19
-
29
yr
old
)
participated
in
this
study
.

A
baseline
blood
sample
was
taken
before
the
onset
of
exercise
and
immediately
after
30
-
min
exercise
bout
.

Neutrophils
were
isolated
using
OptiPrep
Density
Gradient
Medium
(
SIGMA
)
.

Total
RNA
was
extracted
using
TRIzol
.

cRNA
was
hybridized
onto
Affymetrix
U133
+
2
arrays
(
total
of
24

)
.

Estrogen
receptors
(
ERs
)
,
which
mediate
the
proliferative
action
of
estrogens
in
breast
cancer
cells
,
are
ligand
-
dependent
transcription
factors
that
regulate
expression
of
their
primary
target
genes
through
several
mechanisms
.

In
addition
to
direct
binding
to
cognate
DNA
sequences
,
ERs
can
be
recruited
to
DNA
through
other
transcription
factors
(
tethering
)
,
or
affect
gene
transcription
through
modulation
of
signaling
cascades
by
non
-
genomic
mechanisms
of
action
.

To
better
characterize
the
mechanisms
of
gene
regulation
by
estrogens
,
we
have
identified
more
than
700
putative
primary
and
more
than
1500
putative
secondary
target
genes
of
estradiol
in
MCF7
cells
through
microarray
analysis
performed
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
translation
inhibitor
cycloheximide
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
RNA
samples
were
collected
24
h
after
treatment
of
MCF7
cells
with
vehicle
or
17{beta}-estradiol
(
25
nM
)
.

Cells
were
pre

treated
1
h
before
E2
stimulation
with
cycloheximide
(

)
.

Microarray
analysis
was
performed
with
four
replicates
for
each
condition
.

One
third
to
one
half
of
all
infants
born
before
the
28th

BPD
bronchopulmonary
dysplasia
.

 
Our
objective
is
to
evaluate
the
feasibility
of
using
expression
profiling
in
umbilical
cord
tissue
to
discover
molecular
signatures
for
developmental
staging
and
for

Infection
of
the
human
host
by
Streptococcus
pneumoniae
begins
with
colonization
of
the
nasopharynx
,
which
is
mediated
by
adherence
of
bacteria
to
respiratory
epithelium
.

Several
studies
have
indicated
an
important
role
for
the
pneumococcal
capsule
in
this
process
.

Here
,
we
used
microarrays
to
characterize
the
in
vitro
transcriptional
response
of
human
nasopharyngeal
epithelial
Detroit
562
cells
to
adherence
of
serotype
2
-
encapsulated
strain
D39
,
serotype
19F
-
encapsulated
strain
G54
,
serotype
4
-
encapsulated
strain
TIGR4
,
and
their
nonencapsulated
derivatives
(
delta
-
cps
)
.

In
total
,
322
genes
were
found
to
be
upregulated
in
response
to
adherent
pneumococci
.

Twenty
-
two
genes
were
commonly
induced
,
including
those
encoding
several
cytokines
(
e.g.
,
IL-1
-
beta
,
IL-6
)
,
chemokines
(
e.g.
,
IL-8
,
CXCL1/2
)
,
and
transcriptional
regulators
(
e.g.
,
FOS
)
,
consistent
with
an
innate
immune
response
mediated
by
Toll
-
like
receptor
signaling
.

Interestingly
,
85
%
of
genes
was
induced
specifically
by
one
or
more
encapsulated
strains
,
suggestive
of
a
capsule
-
dependent
response
.

Importantly
,
 
purified
capsular
polysaccharides
alone
had
no
effect
.

Over
a
third
of
these
loci
encoded
products
predicted
to
be
involved
in
transcriptional
regulation
and
signal
transduction
,
in
particular
MAPK
signaling
pathways
.

Real
-
time
PCR
of
a
subset
of
ten
genes
confirmed
microarray
data
and
showed
a
time
-
dependent
upregulation
of
especially
innate
immunity
genes
.

Downregulation
of
epithelial
genes
was
most
pronounced
upon
adherent
D39delta
-
cps
,
as
68
%
of
the
161
genes
identified
was
only
repressed
using
this
nonencapsulated
strain
.

In
conclusion
,
we
identified
a
subset
of
host
genes
specifically
induced
by
encapsulated
strains
during
in
vitro
adherence
,
and
have
demonstrated
the
complexity
of
interactions
occurring
during
the
initial
stages
of
pneumococcal
infection
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
We
used
three
different
pneumococcal
strains
and
their
isogenic
nonencapsulated
derivatives
(
delta
-
cps
):
serotype
2
-
encapsulated
strain
D39
,
serotype
19F
-
encapsulated
strain
G54
,
and
serotype
4
-
encapsulated
strain
TIGR4
.

All
experiments
were
performed
in
triplicate
(
3
independent
biological
replicates
)
and
compared
to
uninfected
control
Detroit
562
cells
.

Bacteria
were
allowed
to
adhere
to
the
epithelial
cells
for
2
hours
,
after
which
the
transcriptional
response
of
the
Detroit
cells
was
analyzed
using
Affymetrix
Human
U133
Plus
GeneChips
.

In
addition
to
the
6
strains
mentioned
above
,
we
included
transcriptional
analysis
of
the
epithelial
cell
response
to
low

D39delta

cps
(
giving
adherence
equivalent
to

and

,
but
these

do
not

This

was
initiated
to
determine
the
differences
in
the
transcriptome
of
AML

after
extended

and
subsequently
purified
for

Experiment

:
We
have
established
a
culture
system
whereby
we
retrovirally
transduce
human
CD34
+
cells
,
obtained
from
cord
blood
,
with
the
leukemia
fusion
gene
AML1
-

.

Cells
expressing
this
fusion
protein
are
able
to
proliferate
long

term
in

in
a
cytokine

manner
.

 
AML1
-
ETO
-
expressing
cord
blood
cells
have
a
large
population
of
primitive
self

renewing
CD34

cells
with
continued
abnormal
differentiation
.

We
grow
these
cells
in
serum
-
free
conditions
using
the
BIT
supplement
from
Stem
Cell
Technologies
.

For
the
current
experiments
we
used
cell
cultures
that
had
been
proliferating
in
vitro
for
8
-
12
weeks
,
in
a
cytokine
cocktail
of
SCF
,
TPO
,
FLT3L
,
IL-6
all
at
20
ng

and
IL-3
at
10

Control
cord
blood
samples
that
were
CD34
purified
were
expanded
for
5
-
8
weeks
in
the
same
culture
media
as
used
for
AML1
-
ETO
cells
.

All
samples
were
magnetically
selected
for
the
CD34
+
population
,
returned
to
culture
,
and
one
week
later
again
selected
for
CD34

and
then
lysed
for
RNA

.

Transcription
mediated
by
hypoxia
inducible
factor
(
HIF-1
)
contributes
to
tumor
angiogenesis
and
metastasis
but
is
also
involved
in
the
activation
of
cell
-
death
pathways
and
normal
physiological
processes
.

 
Given
the
complexity
of
HIF-1
signaling
it
could
be
advantageous
to
target
a
subset
of
HIF-1
effectors
rather
than
the
entire
pathway
.

 
We
compared
the
genome
-
wide
effects
of
three
molecules
that
each
interfere
with
the
HIF-1
-
DNA
interaction
:
a
polyamide
targeted
to
the
hypoxia
response
element
(
HRE
)
,
siRNA
targeted
to
HIF-1
_
,
and
echinomycin
,
a
DNA
binding
natural
product
with
a
similar
but
less
specific
sequence
preference
to
the
polyamide
.

 
The
polyamide
affects
a
subset
of
hypoxia
-
induced
genes
that
are
consistent
with
the
binding
site
preferences
of
the
polyamide
.

 
For
comparison
,
siRNA
targeted
to
HIF-1
_
and
echinomycin
each
affect
the
expression
of
nearly
every
gene
induced
by
hypoxia
.

 
Remarkably
,
the
total
number
of
genes
affected
by
either
polyamide
or
HIF-1
_
siRNA
over
a
range
of
thresholds
is
comparable
.

 
The
data
shows
how
polyamides
can
be
used
to
affect
a
subset
of
a
pathway
regulated
by
a
transcription
factor
.

 
In
addition
,
this
study
offers
a
unique
comparison
of
three
complementary
approaches
towards
exogenous
control
of
endogenous
gene
expression
.

Experiment

cells
that
were

,

,
and
echinomycin
were
compared
to
control
cells
that
were
also
DFO

.

 
Cells
not
stimulated
with
DFO
were
also
compared
to
the
DFO

.

 
Three
biological

were
included
for

.

Dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
are
professional
antigen
-
presenting
cells
whose
activity
is
intrinsically
linked
to
the
microenvironment
.

Hypoxia
is
a
condition
of
low
oxygen
tension
occurring
in
inflammatory
tissues
that
creates
a
special
microenvironment
conditioning
cell
physiology
.

We
studied
the
effects
of
hypoxia
on
the
differentiation
of
human
monocytes
into
DCs
.

Immature
DCs
were
differentiated
in
vitro
from
human
monocytes
under
normoxic
(
iDCs
)
or
hypoxic
(
Hi
-
DCs
)
conditions
and
the
gene
expression
profile
was
determined
.

Hi
-
DCs
expressed
novel
hypoxia
-
inducible
genes
and
were
characterized
by
up
-
regulation
of
pathways
associated
with
cell
movement
/
migration
.

 
Experiment
Overall
Design
:
The
expression
profile
of
immature
dendritic
cells
under
normoxia
vs
hypoxia
was
studied
.

Three
healthy
donors
were
used
as
biologial
replicates
.

In
T
-
cell
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
(
T
-
ALL
)
NOTCH
1
receptors
are
frequently
mutated
.

This
leads
to
aberrantly
high
Notch
signaling
,
but
how
this
translates
into
deregulated
cell
cycle
control
and
the
transformed
cell
type
is
poorly
understood
.

In
this
report
,
we
analyze
downstream
responses
resulting
from
the
high
level
of
NOTCH
1
signaling
in
T
-
ALL
.

Notch
activity
,
measured
immediately
downstream
of
the
NOTCH
1
receptor
,
is
high
,
but
expression
of
the
canonical
downstream
Notch
response
genes
HES
1
and
HEY
2
is
low
both
in
primary
cells
from
T
-
ALL
patients
and
in
T
-
ALL
cell
lines
.

This
suggests
that
other
immediate
Notch
downstream
genes
are
activated
,
and
we
found
that
Notch
signaling
controls
the
levels
of
expression
of
the
E3
ubiquitin
ligase
SKP2
and
its
target
protein
p27Kip1
.

We
show
that
in
T
-
ALL
cell
lines
,
recruitment
of
NOTCH
1
ICD
to
the
SKP2
promoter
was
accompanied
by
high
SKP2
and
low
p27Kip1
protein
levels
were
low
.

In
contrast
,
pharmacologically
blocking
Notch
signaling
reversed
this
picture
and
led
to
loss
of
NOTCH
1
ICD
occupancy
of
the
SKP2
promoter
,
decreased
SKP2
and
increased
p27Kip1
expression
.

T
-
ALL
cells
show
a
rapid
G1
-
S
cell
cycle
transition
,
while
blocked
Notch
signaling
resulted
in
G0
/
G1
cell
cycle
arrest
,
also
observed
by
transfection
of
p27Kip1
or
,
to
a
smaller
extent
,
a
dominant
negative
SKP2
allele
.

Collectively
,
our
data
suggest
that
the
aberrantly
high
Notch
signaling
in
T
-
ALL
maintains
SKP2
at
a
high
level
and
reduces
p27Kip1
,
which
leads
to
more
rapid
cell
cycle
progression
.

The
pathogenesis
of
acne
has
been
linked
to
multiple
factors
such
as
increased
sebum
production
,
inflammation
,
follicular
hyperkeratinization
,
and
the
action
of
Propionibacterium
acnes
within
the
follicle
.

In
an
attempt
to
understand
the
specific
genes
involved
in
inflammatory
acne
,
we
performed
gene
expression
profiling
in
acne
patients
.

Skin
biopsies
were
obtained
from
an
inflammatory
papule
and
from
normal
skin
in
six
patients
with
acne
.

Biopsies
were
also
taken
from
normal
skin
of
six
subjects
without
acne
.

Gene
array
expression
profiling
was
conducted
using
Affymetrix
HG
-
U133A
2.0
arrays
comparing
lesional
to
nonlesional
skin
in
acne
patients
and
comparing
nonlesional
skin
from
acne
patients
to
skin
from
normal
subjects
.

Within
the
acne
patients
,
211
genes
are
upregulated
in
lesional
skin
compared
to
nonlesional
skin
.

A
significant
proportion
of
these
genes
are
involved
in
pathways
that
regulate
inflammation
and
extracellular
matrix
remodeling
,
and
they
include
matrix
metalloproteinases
1
and
3
,
IL-8
,
human
beta

defensin

,
and
granzyme
B.
These
data
indicate
a
prominent
role
of
matrix
metalloproteinases
,
inflammatory
cytokines
,
and
antimicrobial
peptides
in
acne
lesions
.

These
studies
are
the
first
describing
the
comprehensive
changes
in
gene
expression
in
inflammatory
acne

and
are
valuable
in
identifying
potential

Atherosclerosis
is
the
major
cause
of
death
in
industrialized
countries
.

This
disease
has
initially
been
characterized
as
a
lipid
disorder
,
but
current
concepts
argue
for
an
inflammatory
disease
,
which
develops
in
the
background
of
hypercholesterolemia
and
other
risk
factors
.

In
response
to
initial
events
of
atherosclerosis
formation
,
such
as
LDL
-
deposition
in
the
subendothelial
space
,
monocytes
and
T
cells
interact
with
the
vessel
wall
.

However
,
little
is
known
about
the
properties
and
the
behavior
of
these
cells
in
this
context
.

Using
familial
hypercholesterolemia
(
FH
)
as
a
model
we
demonstrate
substantial
differences
in
the
gene
expression
of
freshly
isolated
human
monocytes
and
T
lymphocytes
.

In
FH
monocytes
we
found
an
increased
uptake
of
oxidized
LDL
,
elevated
amounts
of
scavenger
receptors
and
adhesion
molecules
,
and
differences
in
the
regulation
of
intracellular
lipoprotein
metabolism
compared
to
monocytes
from
healthy
individuals
.

Furthermore
,
the
monocyte
subpopulation
of
CD14+/CD16
+
cells
is
less
frequent
in
FH
but
exhibits
significantly
higher
levels
of
CD11c
and
CD29
which
increases
the
likelihood
for
their
transmigration
through
the
endothelial
layer
.

The
presence
of
increased
amounts
of
CD69
in
T
lymphocytes
from
FH
patients
suggests
that
these
cells
are
more
activated
than
control
cells
.

Our
results
indicate
that
some
important
steps
of
atherosclerosis
formation
already
take
place
in
circulating
blood
cells
which
extends
current
atherosclerosis
models
to
the
plasma
compartment

These
pleiotropic

include
an
anti

on

.

Since
macrophages
play
a
central
role
in
atherogenesis
,
we
further
characterized
the
effects
on

.

Using

simvastatin
treatment
lead
to
the
downregulation
of
the
expression
of
many
proinflammatory
genes
including
several
chemokines
(
e.g.
MCP-1
,
MIP-1
alpha
and
_
,
RANTES
,
several
other
CC
and
CXC
chemokines
,
IL-2
receptor-
_
,
and
leukemia
inhibitory
factor
)
,
members
of
the
tumor
necrosis
factor
family
(
e.g.
lymphotoxin
beta
and
TRAIL
)
,
VCAM-1
,
ICAM-3
,
and
tissue
factor
(
TF
)
.

Simvastatin
also
modulated
the
expression
of
several
transcription
factors
essential
for
the
inflammatory
response
:
simvastatin
downregulated
the
expression
of
NF
-
kappaB
relA
/
p65
subunit
and
ets-1
transcription
factor
,
and
upregulated
the
expression
of
a
novel
atheroprotective
transcription
factor
,
Kruppel
-
like
factor
2
(
KLF-2
)
.

The
effects
of
simvastatin
on
KLF-2
and
its
target
genes
were
dependent
on
protein
prenylation
,
since
inhibitors
of
protein
prenylation
had
a
similar
inhibitory
effect
in
THP-1
derived
macrophages
.

Additionally
,
by
lentiviral
overexpression
KLF-2
we
showed
that
the
effect
of
simvastatin
on
MCP-1
and
TF
were
dependent
on
KLF-2
.

We
concluded
that
simvastatin
had
a
strong
anti
-
inflammatory
effect
on
macrophages
,
which
includes
upregulation
of
the
atheroprotective
transcription
factor
KLF-2
.

These
findings
further
explain
the
beneficial
pleiotropic
effects
of
statins
on
cardiovascular
diseases

The
estrogen

is
the
master

and
the
archetype
of

.

We
mapped
all

on
a
genome

,
identifying
the
authentic

.

 
Combining
this

,
particularly
in
the

were
able
to
stimulate

.

At
high

,
it
induced

.

The

was
rapidly
endocytosed
via

.

Under

,
some
of
the

were
selected
for

We
sought
to
obtain
the

induced
by
bg

on
HUVECs
in
order
to
get

.

These
findings
illustrate
novel

and
action
mechanism
via
association
with

,
serving
as

for
investigating
the

.

Experiment

We
used

to
analysis
genome

of
significant

induced
by

.

Four

were
compared
with

.

 
121

were
up

,
among
which
members
of
nuclear

)
(
Supporting

.

Members
of
NR4A
exhibit
differential
roles
in
determining
cell

or
cell
death
depending
on
its
location
in
the
nucleus
or

.

NR4A1
(
also
called
Nur77
,

)
mediates
cell
apoptosis
through
translocation
from
nucleus
to
mitochondria
and
induction
of
cytochrome

.

Significant
activation
of
NR4A

suggests
these
orphan

may
be
involved
in
the
mediation
of
bg

CAT
biological
functions

also
induced
the

,
including
interleukin

,
interleukin

and
interleukin

,
as

Human
mesenchymal
stem
cells
(
MSC
)
display
a
high
potential
for
the
development
of
novel
treatment
strategies
for
cartilage
repair
.

However
,
the
pathways
involved
in
their
differentiation
to
functional
and
non
hypertrophic
chondrocytes
remain
largely
unknown
,
despite
the
work
on
embryologic
development
and
the
identification
of
key
growth
factors
including
members
of
the
TGFbeta
,
Hh
,
Wnt
and
FGF
families
.

In
this
study
,
we
asked
if
we
could
identify
specific
biological
networks
independently
from
the
growth
factor
used
(
TGFbeta-3
or
BMP-2
)
.

To
address
this
question
,
we
used
DNA
microarrays
and
performed
large
-
scale
expression
profiling
of
MSC
at
different
time
points
during
their
chondral
differentiation
.

By
comparing
these
data
with
those
obtained
during
their
differentiation
into
osteoblasts
and
adipocytes
,
we
identified
318
genes
specific
for
chondrogenesis
.

We
distributed
the
selected
genes
in
5
classes
according
to
their
kinetic
of
expression
and
used
the
Ingenuity
software
in
order
to
identify
new
biological
networks
.

We
could
reconstruct
3
phases
for
chondral
differentiation
,
characterized
by
functional
pathways
.

The
first
phase
corresponds
to
cell
attachment
and
apoptosis
prevention
with
the
up
-
regulation
of
–ì_5
integrins
,
BCL6
,
NFIL3
,
RGS2
and
down
-
regulation
of
CTGF
and
CYR61
.

The
second
phase
is
characterized
by
a
proliferation
/
differentiation
step
with
the
continuous
expression
of
MAF
,
PGF
,
HGMA1
or
NOTCH3
,
CHI3L1
,
WNT5A
,
LEPR
.

Finally
,
the
last
step
of
differentiation
/
hypertrophy
is
characterized
by
expression
of
DKK1
,
APOD
/
E
,
SERPINF1
and
TIMP4
.

These
data
propose
new
pathways
to
understand
the
complexity
of
MSC
differentiation
to
chondrocytes
and
new
potential
targets
for
cell
therapy
applied
to
cartilage
repair
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
To

,
MSC
were
isolated
from

aspirates
by
adherence
to

and
cultivated
to

.

After
induction
of
chondrogenic
differentiation
with
BMP2
or
TGFbeta-3
,
gene
expression
was
determined
by
microarray
hybridization
after
1
,
3
,
7
and
21
days
and
compared
to
the
undifferentiated
MSC
.

Osteoblasts
are
key
players
in
bone
remodeling
.

The
accessibility
of
human
primary
osteoblast

)
from
bone
explants
render
them
a
lucrative
model
for
studying

Relatively
little
is
known
about
resting
and
dynamic
expression
profiles
of
HObs
and
no
studies
have
been
conducted
to
date
to
systematically
assess
the
osteoblast
transcriptome
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
characterize
HObs
and
investigate
signaling
cascades
and
gene
networks
using
genomewide
expression
profiling
in
resting
and
Bone
Morphogenic
Protein
(
BMP)-2
and
Dexamethasone
induced
cells
.

Our
data
showed
a
vast
number
of
genes
and
networks
expressed
predominantly
in
HObs
as
compared
to
closely
related
cells
such
as
fibroblasts
or
chondrocytes
.

For
instance
,
 
genes
in
the
insulin
-
like
growth
factor
(
IGF
)
signaling
pathway
were
enriched
in
HObs
(
p=0.003
)
and
included
the
binding
proteins
(
IGFBP1
,
2
,
5
)
and
IGF-2
and
its
receptor
.

Another
HOb
specific
expression
pattern
included
leptin
and
its
receptor
(
p<10
-
8)
.

Furthermore
,
after
stimulating
HObs
with
Dexamethasone
or
BMP-2
,
the
expression
of
several
interesting
genes
and
pathways
were
observed
where
data
supported
the
role
of
peripheral
leptin
signaling
in
bone
cell
function
.

In
conclusion
,
we
provide
the
landscape
of
tissue
-
specific
and
dynamic
gene
expression
in
HObs
,
a
resource
,
which
will
allow
utilization
of
osteoblasts
as
a
model
to
study
specific
gene
networks
and
gene
families
related
to
human
bone
physiology
and
diseases
.

Experiment
Overall

were
starved
for
20h
by
adding
complete

the
differences
occurring
in

,
we
performed
gene

.

 
Four
experimental

was
isolated
at
the
indicated

.

 
Canonical

served
as
a

.

 
Each
time
point
was
performed
on
triplicate

except
for

(
n=4
)
.

The
biopsy
samples
obtained
at
implantation
segregated
in
2
distinct
groups
according
to
donor
origin
,
with
a
cluster
of
319
unique

genes
higher
expressed
in
DD
compared
to
LD
kidneys
,
and
329
genes
lower
expressed
(

%
)
.

Using
pathway
analysis
software
a
significant
local
renal
overrepresentation
of
complement
genes
in
DD
implantation
biopsies
was
identified
.

Complement
gene
expression
in
DD
kidneys
related
both
to
donor
death
and
cold
ischemia
duration
,
and
was
associated
with
a
slower
onset
of
renal
allograft
function
.

In
post
-
transplantation
protocol
biopsies
,
there
was
a
continued
overexpression
of
complement
genes
,
regardless
of
donor
source
.

The
local
renal
complement
gene
expression
variability
in
post

transplantation
biopsies
correlated
with
renal
graft
function
.

  

This
study
demonstrates
a
significant
and
clinically
relevant
local
overexpression
of
complement
genes
in
DD
kidneys
at
engraftment
and
continuous
functionally
important
regulation
of
complement
gene
expression
after

,
regardless

is
an
attractive
therapeutic
target
that
deserves
further
investigation
in

Unfortunately
,
prolonged

Similarly
,
no

In
conclusion
,
HIV
infection
induces
a
persistent
T
cell
transcriptional
profile
,
early
in
infection
,
characterized
by
a
dramatic
but
potentially
aberrant
interferon
response
,
and
a
profile
suggesting
an
active
thymic
output
.

We
studied
a
cohort
of
HIV
infected
individuals
with
various
clinical
stages
of
HIV
infection
and
healthy
uninfected
volunteers
as
a
control
group
(
Table

)
.

We
included
5
individuals
with
early
HIV
infection
(
A
)
,
five
with
chronic
progressive
HIV
infection
(
C
)
,
five
individuals
with
non
-
progressive
HIV
infection
with
low
or
undetectable
viral
loads
(
L
)
and
five
HIV
uninfected
individuals
(
N
)
.

The
HIV
infected
individuals
were
never
on
therapy
prior
to
entering
the
study
.

Samples
were
taken
once
from
each
donor
.

Microarray
analysis
was
performed
to
identify
transcriptional
changes
that
occur
during
mucociliary
differentiation
of
human
primary
bronchial
epithelial
cells
cultured
at
an
air
-
liquid
interface
(
ALI
)
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Cells
from
three
different

were
cultured
and
collected
at
11
different

.

Asthma
is
caused
by
a
combination
of
poorly
understood
genetic
and
environmental
factors
.

We
found
multiple
markers
on
chromosome
17q21
to
be
strongly
and
reproducibly
associated
with
childhood
onset
asthma
in
family
and
case
-
referent
panels
with
a
combined
P
<
10
-
12
.

 
In
independent
replication
studies
the
17q21
locus
showed
strong
association
with
diagnosis
of
childhood
asthma
in
2,320
subjects
from
a
cohort
of
German
children
(
P
=
0.0003
)
and
in
3,301
subjects
from
the
British
1958
Birth
Cohort
(
P
=
0.0005
)
.

We
systematically
evaluated
the
relationships
between
markers
of
the
17q21
locus
and
transcript
levels
of
genes
in
EBV
-
transformed
lymphoblastoid
cell
lines
from
children
in
the
asthma
family
panel
used
in
our
association
study
.

The
SNPs
associated
with
childhood
asthma
were
consistently
and
strongly
associated
(
P
<
10
-
22
)
in
cis
with
transcript
levels
of
ORMDL3
,
a
member
of
a
gene
family
that
encode
transmembrane
proteins
anchored
in
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
.

The
results
indicate
that
genetic
variants
regulating
ORMDL3
expression
are
determinants
of
susceptibility
to
childhood
asthma
.

 
Experiment
Overall
Design
:
Gene
expression
levels
were
evaluated
in
404
children
.

We
then
evaluated
the
relationship
between
SNPs
in
the
17q21
region
(
which
show
association
to
asthma
in
the
same
children
)
with
gene
expression
levels
.

During
the
invasive
phase
of
implantation
,
trophoblasts
and
maternal
decidual
stromal
cells
secrete
products
that
regulate
trophoblast
differentiation
and
migration
into
the
maternal
endometrium
.

Paracrine
interactions
between
the
extravillous
trophoblast
and
the
maternal
decidua
are
important
for
successful
embryonic
implantation
,
including
establishing
the
placental
vasculature
,
anchoring
the
placenta
to
the
uterine
wall
,
and
promoting
immuno

acceptance
of
the

.

Global
cross

talk
between
the
trophoblast
and
the
decidua
has
not
been
elucidated
to

,
and
the
current
study
used
a
functional
genomics
approach
to
investigate
these
paracrine
interactions
.

Human
endometrial
stromal

were
decidualized
with
progesterone
and
were
further
treated
with

well
as
angiogenic

factors
in
decidualized
endometrial

.

The
data
suggest
that
the
trophoblast
acts
to
alter
the
local
immune
environment
of
the
decidua
to
facilitate
the
process
of

was
to
identify
gene

.

We
examined

patients
.

Ductal

were
microdissected

have
identified
multiple
genes
that
are

The
results
suggest
that
these
genes
are
involved
in
epithelial

mesenchymal
transition
,
TGFbeta
and
Wnt
signaling
.

These
changes
are
present
in
both

appear
to
be
more
prominent
in

Rotavirus
infection
is
the
single
most
important
cause
of
severe
diarrhea
in
young
children
worldwide
.

We
used
Affymetrix
Human
U95Av2
high
density
oligonucleotide
arrays
to
compare
gene
expression
profiles
in
peripheral
blood
mononuclear
cells
(
PBMC
)
of
10
children
with
acute
rotavirus
diarrhea
and
8
age
-
matched
healthy
children
.

We
also
examined
patterns
of
gene
expression
in
5
convalescent
-
phase
PBMC
samples
from
rotavirus
patients
.

For
data
analysis
,
we
imported
.cel
files
generated
by
Affymetrix
MAS5.0
into
Genetraffic
3.1
software
(
Iobion
)
and
performed
robust
multi
-
chip
analysis
.

We
considered
a
gene
in
patients
differentially
expressed
if
its
level
of
expression
was
at
least
1.5
-
fold
higher
or
lower
than
the
baseline
(
arithmetic
mean
)
of
the
corresponding
gene
in
8
controls
and
if
its
pattern
of
elevated
or
repressed
expression
was
observed
in
at
least
7
of
the
10
patients
.

Using
these
criteria
,
we
identified
~1
%
up-

and
~2
%
down
-
regulated
genes
in
acute
-
phase
PBMC
of
patients
.

Up
-
regulated
genes
included
those
involved
in
the
differentiation
,
maturation
,
activation
,
and
survival
of
B
cells
,
as
well
as
an
array
of
genes
with
function
in
inflammatory
and
antiviral
activities
.

We
observed
a
pattern
of
repressed
expression
of
a
number
of
genes
involved
in
the
various
stages
of
T
-
cell
development
and
activation
.

On
the
basis
of
these
results
,
we
conclude
that
rotavirus
infection
induces
robust
inflammatory
response
and
B
-
cell
activation
but
represses
T
-
cell
response
.

Bmi-1
and
Mel-18
are
close
structural
homologues
that
belong
to
the
polycomb
group
(
PcG
)
of
transcriptional
regulators
of
homeotic
gene
expression
in
development
.

They
are
believed
to
stably
maintain
repression
of
gene
expression
by
altering
the
state
of
chromatin
at
specific
promoters
.

 
A
number
of
clinical
and
experimental
observations
have
also
implicated
Bmi-1
in
tumorigenesis
and
stem
cell
maintenance
.

 
Bmi-1
overexpression
or
amplification
has
been
observed
in
a
number
of
human
malignancies
,
particularly
in
B
-
cell
lymphomas
,
medulloblastomas
and
breast
cancer
.

We
report
here
that
shRNA
-
mediated
knock
-
down
of
either
Bmi-1
or
Mel-18
in
human
medulloblastoma
DAOY
cells
results
in
the
inhibition
of
proliferation
,
loss
of
clonogenic
survival
and
anchorage
-
independent
growth
,
and
suppression
of
xenograft
tumor
formation
in
nude
mice
.

Furthermore
,
overexpression
of
both
Bmi-1
and
Mel-18
significantly
increased
clonogenic
survival
of
Rat1
fibroblasts
.

 
In
contrast
,
stable
downregulation
of
Bmi-1
or
Mel-18
alone
did
not
affect
the
growth
of
SK
-
OV-3
or
U2OS
cancer
cell
lines
or
normal
human
WI38

.

 
Gene
expression
analysis
of
shRNA

expressing
DAOY
cells
has
demonstrated
a
significant
overlap
in
the
Bmi-1-
and
Mel-18
-
regulated
genes
and
revealed
novel
gene
targets
under
their
control
.

 
Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
Bmi-1
and
Mel-18
might
have
overlapping
functions
in
human
tumorigenesis
.

Aplidin
(

is
a
novel

.

Aplidin
has
shown
impressive
in

activity
against
various

.

Based
on
the
results
from

Aplidin
has
selective

in

.

In
an
attempt
to
understand
the
basis
of
Aplidin
action
(
alone
and
in
combination
)
on
leukemia
and
lymphoma
cells
in

and
in
vivo
,
gene
expression
profiling
was
carried
out
.

Results
indicate
that
multiple
cellular
pathways
are
effected
by
treatment
with
Aplidine
including
MAPK
signaling
,
WNT
signaling
,
cell
cycle
and
ATP
synthesis
.

Additionally
we
have
found
that
that
cells
lacking
functional
mitochondria
are
resistant
to
Aplidin
.

Mitochondrial
membrane
potential
and
reactive
oxygen
spicies
production
was
increased
following
Aplidin
treatment
but
the
overall
synthesis
of
ATP
was
decreased
.

Addition
of
AraC
to
Aplidin
resulted
in
depolarization
of
mitochondrial
membrane
and
even
further
increase
of
ROS
production
.

AraC
alone
did
not
affect
the
cellular
ATP
pool
thus
significantly
potentiating
Aplidin
induced
apoptosis
.

Our
studies
suggest
that
cancer
cell
mitochondria
may
be
a
target
of
Aplidin
.

Based
on
these
studies
,
a
phase

of
the
combination
of
Aplidin
and
AraC
is
planned
for
the
treatment
of

Overall
goal
of
the
experiment
was
to
obtain
molecular
insight
into
the
mechanism
of
action
of
Aplidin
alone
as
well
as
its
combination
with
AraC.

Comparison

expression
(

myocardium
)
;

The
purpose
of
our
investigation
was
to
identify
the
transcriptional
basis
for
ultrastructural
and
functional
specialization
of
human
atria
and
ventricles
.

Using
exploratory
microarray
analysis
(
Affymetrix
U133A+B
)
,
we
detected
11,740
transcripts
expressed
in
human
heart
,
representing
the
most
comprehensive
report
of
the
human
myocardial
transcriptome
to
date
.

Variation
in
gene
expression
between
atria
and
ventricles
accounted
for
the
largest
differences
in
this
data
set
,
as
3.300
and
2.974
transcripts
showed
higher
expression
in
atria
and
ventricles
,
respectively
.

Functional
classification
based
on
Gene
Ontology
identified
chamber
-
specific
patterns
of
gene
expression
and
provided
molecular
insights
into
the
regional
specialization
of
cardiomyocytes
,
correlating
important
functional
pathways
to
transcriptional
activity
:
Ventricular
myocytes
preferentially
express
genes
satisfying
contractile
and
energetic
requirements
,
while
atrial
myocytes
exhibit
specific
transcriptional
activities
related
to
neurohumoral
function
.

In
addition
,
several
pro
-
fibrotic
and
apoptotic
pathways
were
concentrated
in
atrial
myocardium
,
substantiating
the
higher
susceptibility
of
atria
to
programmed
cell
death
and
extracellular
matrix
remodelling
observed
in
human
and
experimental
animal
models
of
heart
failure
.

Differences
in
transcriptional
profiles
of
atrial
and
ventricular
myocardium
thus
provide
molecular
insights
into
myocardial
cell
diversity
and
distinct
region
-

Comparison
of
atrial
gene
expression
in
patients
with
permanent
atrial
fibrillation
and
sinus
rhythm
.

Atrial
fibrillation
is
associated
with
increased
expression
of
ventricular
myosin
isoforms
in
atrial
myocardium
,
regarded
as
part
of
a
dedifferentiation
process
.

Whether
re
-
expression
of
ventricular
isoforms
in
atrial
fibrillation
is
restricted
to
transcripts
encoding
for
contractile
proteins
is
unknown
.

Therefore
,
this
study
compares
atrial
mRNA
expression
in
patients
with
permanent
atrial
fibrillation
to
atrial
mRNA
expression
of
patients
with
sinus
rhythm
as
well
as
to
ventricular
gene
expression
using
Affymetrix
U133
arrays
.

In
atrial
myocardium
,
we
identified
1.434
genes
deregulated
in
atrial
fibrillation
,
the
majority
of
which
,
including
key
elements
of
calcium
-
dependent
signaling
pathways
,
displayed
down
-
regulation
.

Functional
classification
based
on
Gene
Ontology
provided
the
specific
gene
sets
of
the
interdependent
processes
of
structural
,
contractile
and
electrophysiological
remodeling
.

In
addition
,
we
demonstrate
for
the
first
time
a
prominent
up
-
regulation
of
transcripts
involved
in
metabolic
activities
,
suggesting
an
adaptive
response
to
an
increased
metabolic
demand
in
fibrillating
atrial
myocardium
.

Ventricular
-
predominant
genes
were
five
times
more
likely
to
be
up
-
regulated
in
atrial
fibrillation
(
174
genes
up
-
regulated
,
35
genes
down
-
regulated
)
,
while
atrial
-
specific
transcripts
were
predominantly
down
-
regulated
(
56
genes
up
-
regulated
,
564
genes
down
-
regulated
)
.

Overall
,
in
atrial
myocardium
,
functional
classes
of
genes
characteristic
of
ventricular
myocardium
were
found
to
be
up
-
regulated
(
e.g.
metabolic
processes
)
while
functional
classes
predominantly
expressed
in
atrial
myocardium
were
down
-
regulated
in
atrial
fibrillation
(
e.g.
signal
transduction
and
cell
communication
)
.

Therefore
,
dedifferentiation
with
adoption
of
a
ventricular
-
like
signature
is
a
general
feature
of
the
fibrillating
atrium
,
uncovering
the
transcriptional
response
pattern
in
pmAF

Anti

estrogens
and
aromatase
inhibitors
are
important
drugs
in
the
treatment
of
estrogen
-
dependent
breast
cancer
.

 
In
order
to
investigate
the
effects
of
these
drugs
on
gene
expression
in
breast
cancer
cells
,
we
treated
estrogen
receptor
-
positive
MCF-7
cells
,
stably
transfected
with
the
aromatase
gene
(
known
as
MCF-7aro
cells
)
,
with
testosterone
,
17_-estradiol
,
two
aromatase
inhibitors
(
letrozole
and
anastrozole
)
,
and
an
anti
-
estrogen
(
tamoxifen
)
.

 
Microarray
analyses
using
Affymetrix
Human
Genome
U133A
GeneChips
were
carried
out
using
total
RNA
isolated
from
the
control
and
treated
cells
.

 
When
comparing
the
effect
of
each
inhibitor
on
gene
expression
we
observe
that
letrozole
and
anastrozole
are
more
similar
in
terms
of
the
genes
they
affect
,
compared
to
treatment
with
tamoxifen
.

 
The
results
of
this
study
provide
us
with
a
better
understanding
of
the
actions
of
both
aromatase
inhibitors
and
anti
-
estrogens
at
the
molecular
level
.

 
We
believe
that
the
results
of
this
study
serve
as
the
first
step
in
identifying
unique
expression
patterns
following
drug
treatment
,
and
that
this
will
ultimately
be
useful
in
customizing
patient
treatment

Idiopathic
inflammatory
myopathies
(
polymyositis

The
pathogenic
pathways
responsible
for
muscle

damage
and
dysfunction
in
myositis
are
not
currently
well
defined
.

Identification
of
such

may
help
to
design
novel

also
help

:
Muscle

Obesity
results
from
a
chronic
imbalance
between
energy
intake
and
energy
expenditure
,
with
excess
calories
stored
as
fat
.

As
such
,
weight
loss
has
long
been
considered
as
a
primary
goal
of
treatment
for
obesity
.

A
surgical
treatment
of
severe
obesity
such
as
gastric
bypass
provides
the
most
dramatic
reductions
in
body
weight
,
and
a
well
-
known
effect
of
weight
loss
is
an
improvement
in
insulin
sensitivity
.

However
,
the
molecular
mechanism
underlying
this
association
remains
unclear
.

Thus
,
we
profiled
skeletal
muscle
of
morbidly
obese
patients
before
and
after
gastric
bypass
surgery
.

Results
from
this
project
will
provide
global
patterns
of
gene
expression
with
weight
loss
,
which
help
to
understand
the
pathogenesis
of
obesity
at
the
molecular
level
.

Experiment

To
identify
responsive
genes
to
weight

Human
monocyte

via
galectin-1
or
LPS
.

Experiment
Overall
Design
:
4
conditions
with
3
replicates
of
each
include
control
or
intreated
immature
MDDCS
,
galectin-1
treated
MDDCs
,
LPS
treated
MDDCs
,
and
vehicle
control
MDDCs
.

(
each
replicate
is
from
a
distinct
DONOR
)
.

Dendritic
cells
(
DCs
)
are
potent
mediators
of
the
immune
response
,
and
can
be
activated
by
exogenous
pathogen
components
.

Galectin-1
is
a
member
of
the
conserved
beta
-
galactoside
-
binding
lectin
family
that
binds
galactoside
residues
on
cell
surface
glycoconjugates
.

Galectin-1
is
known
to
play
a
role
in
immune
regulation
via
action
on
multiple
immune
cells
.

However
,
its
effects
on
human
DCs
are
unknown
.

In
this
study
,
we
show
that
galectin-1
induces
a
phenotypic
and
functional
maturation
in
human
monocyte
-
derived
DCs
(
MDDCs
)
similar
to
but
distinct
from
the
activity
of
the
exogenous
pathogen
stimuli
,
LPS
.

Immature
human
MDDCs
exposed
to
galectin-1
up
-
regulated
cell
surface
markers
characteristic
of
DC
maturation
(
CD40
,
CD83
,
CD86
,
and
HLA
-
DR
)
,
secreted
high
levels
of
IL-6
and
TNF
-
alpha
,
stimulated
T
cell
proliferation
,
and
showed
reduced
endocytic
capacity
,
similar
to
LPS
-
matured
MDDCs
.

However
,
unlike
LPS
-
matured
DCs
,
galectin-1
-
treated
MDDCs
did
not
produce
the
Th1
-
polarizing
cytokine
IL-12
.

Microarray
analysis
revealed
that
in
addition
to
modulating
many
of
the
same
DC
maturation
genes
as
LPS
,
galectin-1
also
uniquely
up
-
regulated
a
significant
subset
of
genes
related
to
cell
migration
through
the
extracellular
matrix
(
ECM
)
.

Indeed
,
compared
with
LPS
,
galectin-1
-
treated
human
MDDCs
exhibited
significantly
better
chemotactic
migration
through
Matrigel
,
an
in
vitro
ECM
model
.

Our
findings
show
that
galectin-1
is
a
novel
endogenous
activator
of
human
MDDCs
that
up
-
regulates
a
significant
subset
of
genes
distinct
from
those
regulated
by
a
model
exogenous
stimulus
(
LPS
)
.

One
unique
effect
of
galectin-1
is
to
increase
DC
migration
through
the
ECM
,
suggesting
that
galectin-1
may
be
an
important
component
in
initiating
an
immune
response
.

Rett
syndrome
(
RTT
)
is
an
X
-
linked
dominant
neurodevelopmental
disorder
caused
by
mutations
in
MECP2
,
encoding
methyl
-
CpG
-
binding
protein
2
.

MeCP2
is
a
transcriptional
repressor
elevated
in
mature
neurons
and
is
predicted
to
be
required
for
neuronal
maturation
by
regulating
multiple
target
genes
.

Identifying
primary
gene
targets
in
either
Mecp2
-
deficient
mice
or
human
RTT
brain
has
proven
to
be
difficult
,
perhaps
because
of
the
transient
requirement
for
MeCP2
during
neuronal
maturation
.

In
order
to
experimentally
control
the
timing
of
MeCP2
expression
and
deficiency
during
neuronal
maturation
,
human
SH
-
SY5Y
cells
undergoing
mature
neuronal
differentiation
were
transfected
with
methylated
MeCP2
oligonucleotide
decoy
to
disrupt
the
binding
of
MeCP2
to
endogenous
targets
.

Genome
-
wide
expression
microarray
analysis
identified
all
four
known
members
of
the
inhibitors
of
differentiation
or
inhibitors
of
DNA
-
binding
(
ID1
,
ID2
,
ID3
and
ID4
)
subfamily
of
helix
-
loop
-
helix
genes
as
novel
neuronal
targets
of
MeCP2
.

Chromatin
immunoprecipitation
analysis
confirmed
binding
of
MeCP2
near
or
within
the
promoters
of
ID1
,
ID2
and
ID3
,
and
quantitative
RT
-
PCR
confirmed
increased
expression
of
all
four
I
d
genes
in
Mecp2
-
deficient
mouse
brain
.

All
four
ID
proteins
were
significantly
increased
in
Mecp2
-
deficient
mouse
and
human
RTT
brain
using
immunofluorescence
and
laser
scanning
cytometric
analyses
.

Because
of
their
involvement
in
cell
differentiation
and
neural
development
,
ID
genes
are
ideal
primary
targets
for
MeCP2
regulation
of
neuronal
maturation
that
may
explain
the
molecular
pathogenesis
of
RTT
.

Intervertebral

IVD
)
cells
experience
a
broad
range
of
physical
stimuli
under
physiologic
conditions
,
including
alterations
in
their
osmotic
environment
.

In
this
study
,
the
gene
expression
profile
of
human
IVD
cells
was
quantified
with
gene
array
technology
following
exposure
to
varying
osmolarity
in
order
to
capture
the
biological
responses
for
a
broad

.

A
total
of
42
genes
were
identified
in
IVD
cells
as
significantly
changed
following
culture
under
hyper

conditions
,
while
a
total
of
18
genes
were
identified
as
significantly
changed
under
hypo

.

Gene
expression
patterns
were
verified
using

Genes
identified
in

include
those
related
to
cytoskeleton

was
the

of
the

Polycystic
ovary
syndrome
(
PCOS
)
is
a
common
endocrine
and
metabolic
disorder
that
affects
5
-
10
%
of
reproductive
aged
women
.

 
The
hallmark
characteristic
of
PCOS
is
increased
ovarian
androgen
synthesis
.

 
Previous
studies
by
our
laboratory
demonstrated
that
increased
androgen
synthesis
is
a
stable
biochemical
phenotype
of
PCOS
theca
cells
which
are
the
primary
source
of
ovarian
androgen
production
.

 
The
increase
in
theca
cell
steroidogenesis
was
due
to
an
increase
in
expression
of
several
steroidogenic
enzymes
including
CYP17
and
CYP11A

but
not
StAR
.

 
Interestingly
,
the
anti
-
epileptic
drug
valproic
acid
induces
increased
theca
cell
androgen
synthesis
and
increased
CYP17
and
CYP11A
mRNA
levels
.

In
this
study
we
have
characterized
the
gene
expression
profiles
of
theca
cells
obtained
from
normal
or
polycystic
ovaries
which
were
maintained
in
the
absence
(
UNT
)
or
presence
(
VPA
)
of
valproic
acid
.

 
The
data
identifed
new
candidate
genes
and
novel
signaling
pathways
which
may
contribute
to
the
manifestation
of
PCOS
phenotypes
including
increased
androgen
production
.

 
The
experiments
in
this
study
were
carried
using
the
Affymetrix
U133A
and
U133B
oligonucleotide
chips
.

Samples
were
obtained
from
8
patients
with
Barrett

.

Samples
representative
of
the
normal
esophageal
epithelium
(
N
)
,
Barrett–•s
esophagus
(
B
)
and
esophageal
adenocarcinomas
(
ADC
)
were
obtained
from
every
patient
by
experienced
GI
pathologists
.

RNA
were
extracted
and
samples
were
profiled
for
detection
of
genes
differentially
expressed
in
B
and
ADC
relative
to
N
and
in
ADC
relative
to

Pharmacogenomic
identification
of
targets
for

with
the
topoisomerase

.

The
response
of
tumor
cells
to
the
unusual
form
of
DNA
damage
caused
by
topoisomerase
poisons
such
as
camptothecin
(
CPT
)
is
poorly
understood
,
and
knowledge
regarding
which
drugs
can
be
effectively
combined
with
CPT
is
lacking
.

To
better
understand
the
response
of
tumor
cells
to
CPT
and
to
identify
potential
targets
for
adjuvant
therapy
,
we
examined
global
changes
in
mRNA
abundance
in
HeLa
cells
after
CPT
treatment
using
Affymetrix
U133A
GeneChips
,
which
include
all
annotated
human
genes
(
22,283
probe
sets
)
.

Statistical

using
a

and
a

testing
identified
188
probe
sets
that
are
induced
and
495
that
are

8
h
after
CPT
treatment
at
a
False
Discovery
Rate
of
<
0.05
and
a
minimum
3

.

This
pharmacogenomic
approach
led
us
to
identify
two
pathways
that
are
CPT
induced
:
(
a
)
the
epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
;
and
(
b
)
nuclear
factor
-
kappaB
-
regulated
antiapoptotic
factors
.

Experiments
using
HeLa
cells
in
our
lab
and
prior
animal
model
studies
performed
elsewhere
confirm
that
inhibitors
of
these
respective
pathways
super
-
additively
enhance
CPT
's

,
suggesting
their
potential
as
targets
for
adjuvant

The
source
of
aldosterone
in
30
to
40
%
of
patients
with
primary
hyperaldosteronism
(
PA
)
is
unilateral
aldosterone
-
producing
adenoma
(
APA
)
.

The
mechanisms
causing
elevated
aldosterone
production
in
APA
are
unknown
.

Herein
,
we
examined
expression
of
G
-
protein
coupled
receptors
(
GPCR
)
in
APA
and
demonstrate
that
compared
to
normal
adrenals
there
is
a
general
elevation
of
certain
GPCR
in
many
APA
and/or
ectopic
expression
of
GPCR
in
others
.

RNA
samples
from
normal
adrenals
(
n
=
5
)
,
APAs
(
n
=
10
)
,
and
cortisol

producing
adenomas
(
CPAs
)
(
n=13
)
were
used
on
15
genomic
expression
arrays
,
each
of
which
included
223
GPCR
transcripts
presented
in
at
least
one
out
of
15
of
the
independent
microarrays
.

The
array
results
were
confirmed
using
real
-
time
RT
-
PCR
(
qPCR
)
.

Four
GPCR
transcripts
exhibited
a
statistically
significant
increase
that
was
greater
than
3
-
fold
compared
to
normal
adrenals
,
suggesting
a
general
increase
in
expression
compared
to
normal
adrenal
glands
.

Four
GPCR
transcripts
exhibited
a
greater
than
15
-
fold
increase
of
expression
in
one
or
more
of
the
APA
samples
compared
to
normal
adrenals
.

qPCR
analysis
confirmed
array
data
and
found
the
receptors
with
the
highest
fold
increase
in
APA
expression
to
be
luteinizing
hormone
receptor
(
LH
-
R
)
,
serotonin
receptor
4
(
HTR4
)
,
gonadotropin
-
releasing
hormone
receptor
(
GnRHR
)
,
glutamate
receptor
metabotropic
3
(
GRM3
)
,
endothelin
receptor
type
B
-
like
protein
(
GPR37
)
,
and
ACTH
receptor
(
MC2R
)
.

There
are
also
sporadic
increased
expressions
of
these
genes
in
the
CPAs
.

Together
,
these
findings
suggest
a
potential
role
of
altered
GPCR
expression
in
many
cases
of
PA
and
provide
candidate
GPCR
for
further
study
.

obtained
through
the
Cooperative
Human

(

and
Clontech
(

.

All
the
normal
adrenal
samples
came
from
patients
that
underwent
adrenalectomy
along
with
a
renalectomy
due
to
renal
carcinoma
.

The
adrenal
samples
acquired
from
autopsies
were
obtained
no
more
than
six
hours
after
death
,
and
it
was
confirmed
that
the
causes
of
death
were
unrelated
to
adrenal
function
.

Real

quantitative
RT

was
used
to
check
the
legitimacy
of
the
normal
control
adrenal
samples
.

Examination
of
tissue
sections
from
each
adrenal

also
suggested
normal

.

 
The
APA
samples
were
obtained
from
the
Departments
of
Medicine
at
UT
Southwestern
and
Division
of
Endocrinology
at
the
University
of
Padua
.

All
APA
samples
were
from
Conn–•s
Syndrome
patients
with
significantly
elevated
circulating
aldosterone
that
was
lowered
to
the
normal
range
after
surgical
removal
of
the
tumor
.

Thirty
-
two
adenomas
were
collected
from
patients
with
primary
hyperaldosteronism
.

Twenty
-
eight
of
these
adenomas
had
levels
of
CYP11B2
that
were
two
standard
deviations
(
SD
)
greater
than
seen
in
normal
adrenal
glands
and
these
samples
were
used
for
analyses
.

It
is
currently
not
clear
if
the
adenomas
with
low
CYP11B2
expression
are
the
source
of
aldosterone
in
these
patients
.

Other
studies
suggest
that
subcapsular
micronodules
have
varying
expression
of
steroidogenic
enzymes
-
some
with
aldosterone
synthase
and
some
without
(
Shigematsu
et

)
.

Future
studies
are
required
to
determine
if
some
tumor
-
bearing
adrenals
from
primary
hyperaldosteronsim
patients
also
have
small
CYP11B2
positive
micronodules
as
the
source
of
aldosterone

Bipolar

a

.

We
used
microarray

(
Affymetrix

)
to
determine
the
expression
of
approximately
22
000

transcripts
in
post

brain
tissue
(

from
patients
with

disorder
and
matched

.

Orbitofrontal

tissue
from
a
cohort
of
30
subjects
was
investigated
and
the
final
analysis
included
10
bipolar
and
11

.

Differences
between
disease
and
control
groups
were
identified
using
a
rigorous
statistical
analysis
with
correction
for
confounding
variables
and
multiple
testing
.

Our
results
suggest
that
48h
of
immobilization
increases
expression
of
mRNA
for
components
of
the
UPP
and
MT
function
while
decreasing
mRNA
and
protein
for
components
involved
in
ECM
integrity
.

We
hypothesized
that
48h
of
immobilization
would
increase
gene
expression
and
respective
protein
products
for
components
of
the
ubiquitin
proteasome
pathway
(
UPP

.

Essential
fatty
acids
(
FA
)
are
not
only
energy
-
rich
molecules
;
they
are
also
an
important
component
of
the
membrane
bilayer
and
recently
have
been
implicated
in
induction
of
fatty
acid
synthase
(
FAS
)
and
other
genes
.

 
Using
gene
chip
analysis
,
we
have
found
that
arachidonic
acid
(
AA
)
,
an
omega-6
fatty
acid
,
induced
11
genes
that
are
regulated
by
NFkappaB.
 
We
verified
gene
induction
by
omega-6
fatty
acids
including
COX2
,
IKBA
,
NFKB
,
GMCSF
,
IL1B
,
CXCL1
,
TNFA
,
IL6
,
LTA
,
IL8
,
PPARG
,
and
ICAM1
using
qRTPCR
.

 
PGE2
synthesis
was
increased
within
5min
of
addition
of
AA
.

 
Analysis
of
upstream
signal
transduction
showed
that
within
5min
of
FA
addition
,
phophatidylinositol
3
-
kinase
(
PI3
K
)
was
significantly
activated
followed
by
activation
of
Akt
at
30min
.

 
ERK1
and
2
,
p38
,
and
SAPK
/
JNK
were
not
phosphorylated
after
omega-6
FA
addition
.

 
Thirty
minutes
after
FA
addition
,
we
found
a
significant
3
-
fold
increase
in
translocation
of
NFkappaB
transcription
factor
to
the
nucleus
.

 
Addition
of
non
-
steroidal
anti
-
inflammatory
drug
(
NSAID
)
caused
a
decrease
in
cox-2
protein
synthesis
,
PGE2
synthesis
as
well
as
inhibition
of
PI3
K
activation
.

 
We
have
previously
shown
that
AA
induced
proliferation
is
also
blocked
(
P<0.001
)
by
PI3
K
inhibitor
LY294002
.

 
LY294002
also
significantly
inhibited
the
AA
induced
gene
expression
of
COX2
,
IL1B
,
GMCSF
,
and
ICAM1
.

 
Taken
together
,
the
data
suggests
that
AA
via
conversion
to
PGE2
plays
an
important
role
in
stimulation
of
growth
related
genes
and
proliferation
via
PI3
K
signaling
and
NFkappaB
translocation
to
the
nucleus
.

The

shows
a
wide
morphological
heterogeneity
which
ranges
from
B
-
lymphocytes
(
BL
)
to
plasma
cells
(

.

By
means
of
genome

wide
expression
profiling
we
have
been
able
to
identify
genes
exclusively
deregulated
in
BL
and
PC
from
WM
,
but
with
a
similar
expression
pattern
in
their
corresponding
cell
-
counterparts
from
CLL
and

,
as
well
as
normal
individuals
.

The
differentially
expressed
genes
have
important
functions
in
B
-
cell
differentiation
and
oncogenesis
.

Thus
,
two
of
the
genes
down

regulated
in
WM
-
BL
were
IL4R
,
which
plays
a
relevant
role
in

,
and
BACH2
that

the
development
of
class

PC
.

Interestingly
,
one
of
the
up
-
regulated
genes
in
WM
-
BL
was
IL6
.

A
set
of
4
genes
was
able
to
discriminate

from
WM
and
CLL
:
LEF1
(
WNT/¬ßcatenin
pathway
)
,
MARCKS
,

and
FMOD
.

We
also
found
deregulation
of
genes
involved
in
plasma
cell
differentiation
such
as
PAX5
which
was
overexpressed
in
WM
-
PC
,
and
IRF4
and
BLIMP1
which
were
underexpressed
.

In
addition
,
three
of

target
genes
activated
by
PAX5

,
BLNK
and
SYK-
were
up

regulated
in

In
summary
,
these

indicate
that
both

Scientific
progress

and
raised
the
hope
of
identifying
treatments
to

,
researchers
have
begun
to
characterize
the
cascade
of
molecular
events
which
lead
to
the
major
histopathological
features
of
the

:
neuritic
plaques
,
which
contain
extra
-
cellular
deposits
of
amyloid
beta
-
peptides
(
Abeta
)
;
neurofibrillary
tangles
,
which
contain
the
hyperphosphorylated
form
of
the
intracellular
,
microtubule
-
associated
protein
,
tau
;
and
a
loss
of
neurons
and
synapses
.

These
molecular
events
provide
targets
for
the
development
of
promising
new
treatments
.

For
example
,
A
-
beta
has
been
postulated
to
trigger
a
cascade
of
events
that
are
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of

.

This
proposal
hopes
to
provide
new
information
about
the
genes
that
are
preferentially
expressed
in
the
development
of
AD
histopathology
,
including
the
over

of
APP
,
amyloid
-
induced
neurotoxicity
,
and
hyperphosphorylation

as
well
as
bring

Summary
:
  
Genetic
disorders
of
muscle
cause
muscular
dystrophy
,
and
are
some
of
the
most
common
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
.

Muscle
also
rapidly
remodels
in
response
to
training
and
innervation
.

Muscle
weakness
and
wasting
is
important
in
such
conditions
as
aging
,
critical
care
medicine
,
space
flight
,
and
diabetes
.

Finally
,
muscle
can
also
be
used
to
investigate
systemic
defects
,
and
the
compensatory
mechansisms
invoked
by
cells
to
overcome
biochemical
and
genetic
abnormalities
.

Here
,
we
provide
a
13
group
data
set
for
comparative
profiling
of
human
skeletal
muscle
.

Groups
studied
are
:
Normal
human
skeletal
muscle
,
Acute
quadriplegic
myopathy
(
AQM
;
critical
care
myopathy
)
,
Juvenile
dermatomyositis
(
JDM
)
,
Amyotophic
lateral
sclerosis
(
ALS
)
,
spastic
paraplegia
(
SPG4
;
spastin
)
,
Fascioscapulohumeral
muscular
dystrophy
(
FSHD
)
,
Emery
Dreifuss
muscular
dystrophy
(
both
X

recessive
emerin
form
;
autosomal
dominant
Lamin
A
/
C
form
)
,
Becker
muscular
dystrophy
(
partial
loss
of
dystrophin
)
,
Duchenne
muscular
dystrophy
(
complete
loss
of
dystrophin
)
,
Calpain

)
,
dysferlin
(
LGMD2B
)
,
FKRP
(

;
homozygous
for
a
missense
mutation
)
.

U133A

and
U133B
microarrays
are
both
available
.

Hypothesis
:
  
This
data
set
is
able
to
define
biochemical
pathways
that
are
either
specific
for
a
disease
group
,
or
shared
between
disease
groups
.

For
example
,
this
data
set
has
been
used
to
determine
the
biochemical
pathway
perturbations
that
are
shared
between
the
two
different
types
of
Emery
Dreifuss
muscular
dystrophy
(
lamin
A
/
C
,
and
emerin
)
.

 
Specific
Aim
:
  
The
specific
aim
of
this
study
is
to
determine
the
disease
-
specific
transcriptional
profiles
of
these
13
patient
groups
,
and
to
determine
if
these
expression
fingerprints
provide
either
pathophysiology
or
diagnostic
information
for
these
diseases
.

Some

the
groups
in
this
large
data
set
have
been
